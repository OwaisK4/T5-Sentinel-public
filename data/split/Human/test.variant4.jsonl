it may attack them, or they may be detrimental to the survival and progression of the human race. this hypothesis is solidified when sergeant deduces that the ship is a formic ark, a colony ship that has been in flight for centuries. bean sends sergeant alone to investigate the ship, and he escapes an attack by small formic-like animals they call \"rabs\". after this initial encounter, bean reveals his full plan to his children. they must find out who is piloting this ship and attempting to terraform the planet it orbits. it was bean's intention all along to have his children live on this planet and found their new species in safety as soon as he picked it up on radar as lying within the goldilocks zone. armed with sergeant's weapons and a sedative fog spray ender devised, sergeant commands defenses as carlotta leads their group to the helm with bean in contact the whole time. the spray proves effective, and they soon find the hive queen's chamber to find her, and many workers, dead. eventually they find living male formics in one of the piloting helms. in an attempt to communicate, ender surrenders himself by drifting close to them in zero gravity. the male drones come close and communicate with ender via mental images. the group learns that the ark was sent long before ender wiggin, whom bean's son is named for, wiped out the buggers. after the queen on their ship died, the workers died without her link, yet the males lived and tried to survive and keep the ship running despite losing numbers to the feral rabs. the group strikes a deal that if the children can wipe out the rabs, they can stay with the formics and help cultivate the planet. when bean learns from the male drones that ender wiggin is carrying a queen's cocoon looking for a home, and that formic workers do have minds of their own contrary to popular belief, he demands to speak with the formics in order to warn ender, despite risking his life in the journey. accepting that his children have achieved beyond his wildest expectations, bean risks his life by docking with the ark's cargo hold to float down into the ecotat. laying in the grass and basking in the artificial sunlight, bean communes for three days with the formic males. though the formics think it is silly to believe the queen would hide anything from them, bean learns that workers could rebel against a queen and regain their free will. after sleeping, his children wake him informing him that by studying how the hive queen suppresses her workers, ender devised and administered a virus that will develop an organelle to shut off their growth genome, leaving their intelligence intact. with renewed hope for the future, bean looks at the beauty around him and remember all those whom he loved and who loved him in his life. with his children's help, he stands at four and a half meters for the first time in years, and walks with belabored breathing in the sunlight. happy for his children and for his own short but brilliant life, bean lies down and dies in peace.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced. nature to be commanded must be obeyed; and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule.\niv.\ntowards the effecting of works, all that man can do is to put together or put asunder natural bodies. the rest is done by nature working within.\nv.\nthe study of nature with a view to works is engaged in by the mechanic, the mathematician, the physician, the alchemist, and the magician; but by all (as things now are) with slight endeavour and scanty success.\nvi.\nit would be an unsound fancy and self-contradictory to expect that things which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried.\nvii.\nthe productions of the mind and hand seem very numerous in books and manufactures. but all this variety lies in an exquisite subtlety and derivations from a few things already known; not in the number of axioms.\nviii.\nmoreover the works already known are due to chance and experiment rather than to sciences; for the sciences we now possess are merely systems for the nice ordering and setting forth of things already invented; not methods of invention or directions for new works.\nix.\nthe cause and root of nearly all evils in the sciences is this -- that while we falsely admire and extol the powers of the human mind we neglect to seek for its true helps.\nx.\nthe subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of the senses and understanding; so that all those specious meditations, speculations, and glosses in which men indulge are quite from the purpose, only there is no one by to observe it.\nxi.\nas the sciences which we now have do not help us in finding out new works, so neither does the logic which we now have help us in finding out new sciences.\nxii.\nthe logic now in use serves rather to fix and give stability to the errors which have their foundation in commonly received notions than to help the search after truth. so it does more harm than good.\nxiii.\nthe syllogism is not applied to the first principles of sciences, and is applied in vain to intermediate axioms; being no match for the subtlety of nature. it commands assent therefore to the proposition, but does not take hold of the thing.\nxiv.\nthe syllogism consists of propositions, propositions consist of words, words are symbols of notions. therefore if the notions themselves (which is the root of the matter) are confused and over-hastily abstracted from the facts, there can be no firmness in the superstructure. our only hope therefore lies in a true induction.\nxv.\nthere is no soundness in our notions whether logical or physical. substance, quality, action, passion, essence itself, are not sound notions: much less are heavy, light, dense, rare, moist, dry, generation, corruption, attraction, repulsion, element, matter, form, and the like; but all are fantastical and ill defined.\nxvi.\nour notions of less general species, as man, dog, dove, and of the immediate perceptions of the sense, as hot, cold, black, white, do not materially mislead us; yet even these are sometimes confused by the flux and alteration of matter and the mixing of one thing with another. all the others which men have hitherto adopted are but wanderings, not being abstracted and formed from things by proper methods.\nxvii.\nnor is there less of wilfulness and wandering in the construction of axioms than in the formations of notions; not excepting even those very principles which are obtained by common induction; but much more in the axioms and lower propositions educed by the syllogism.\nxviii.\nthe discoveries which have hitherto been made in the sciences are such as lie close to vulgar notions, scarcely beneath the surface. in order to penetrate into the inner and further recesses of nature, it is necessary that both notions and axioms be derived from things by a more sure and guarded way; and that a method of intellectual operation be introduced altogether better and more certain.\nxix.\nthere are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. the one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable, proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. and this way is now in fashion. the other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. this is the true way, but as yet untried.\nxx.\nthe understanding left to itself takes the same course (namely, the former) which it takes in accordance with logical order. for the mind longs to spring up to positions of higher generality, that it may find rest there; and so after a little while wearies of experiment. but this evil is increased by logic, because of the order and solemnity of its disputations.\nxxi.\nthe understanding left to itself, in a sober, patient, and grave mind, especially if it be not hindered by received doctrines, tries a little that other way, which is the right one, but with little progress; since the understanding, unless directed and assisted, is a thing unequal, and quite unfit to contend with the obscurity of things.\nxxii.\nboth ways set out from the senses and particulars, and rest in the highest generalities; but the difference between them is infinite. for the one just glances at experiment and particulars in passing, the other dwells duly and orderly among them. the one, again, begins at once by establishing certain abstract and useless generalities, the other rises by gradual steps to that which is prior and better known in the order of nature.\nxxiii.\nthere is a great difference between the idols of the human mind and the ideas of the divine. that is to say, between certain empty dogmas, and the true signatures and marks set upon the works of creation as they are found in nature.\nxxiv.\nit cannot be that axioms established by argumentation should avail for the discovery of new works; since the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument. but axioms duly and orderly formed from particulars easily discover the way to new particulars, and thus render sciences active.\nxxv.\nthe axioms now in use, having been suggested by a scanty and manipular experience and a few particulars of most general occurrence, are made for the most part just large enough to fit and take these in: and therefore it is no wonder if they do not lead to new particulars. and if some opposite instance, not observed or not known before, chance to come in the way, the axiom is rescued and preserved by some frivolous distinction; whereas the truer course would be to correct the axiom itself.\nxxvi.\nthe conclusions of human reason as ordinarily applied in matter of nature, i call for the sake of distinction anticipations of nature (as a thing rash or premature). that reason which is elicited from facts by a just and methodical process, i call interpretation of nature.\nxxvii.\nanticipations are a ground sufficiently firm for consent; for even if men went mad all after the same fashion, they might agree one with another well enough.\nxxviii.\nfor the winning of assent, indeed, anticipations are far more powerful than interpretations; because being collected from a few instances, and those for the most part of familiar occurrence, they straightway touch the understanding and fill the imagination; whereas interpretations on the other hand, being gathered here and there from very various and widely dispersed facts, cannot suddenly strike the understanding; and therefore they must needs, in respect of the opinions of the time, seem harsh and out of tune; much as the mysteries of faith do.\nxxix.\nin sciences founded on opinions and dogmas, the use of anticipations and logic is good; for in them the object is to command assent to the proposition, not to master the thing.\nxxx.\nthough all the wits of all the ages should meet together and combine and transmit their labours, yet will no great progress ever be made in science by means of anticipations; because radical errors in the first concoction of the mind are not to be cured by the excellence of functions and remedies subsequent.\nxxxi.\nit is idle to expect any great advancement in science from the superinducing and engrafting of new things upon old. we must begin anew from the very foundations, unless we would revolve for ever in a circle with mean and contemptible progress.\nxxxii.\nthe honour of the ancient authors, and indeed of all, remains untouched; since the comparison i challenge is not of wits or faculties, but of ways and methods, and the part i take upon myself is not that of a judge, but of a guide.\nxxxiii.\nthis must be plainly avowed: no judgment can be rightly formed either of my method or of the discoveries to which it leads, by means of anticipations (that is to say, of the reasoning which is now in use); since i cannot be called on to abide by the sentence of a tribunal which is itself on its trial.\nxxxiv.\neven to deliver and explain what i bring forward is no easy matter; for things in themselves new will yet be apprehended with reference to what is old.\nxxxv.\nit was said by borgia of the expedition of the french into italy, that they came with chalk in their hands to mark out their lodgings, not with arms to force their way in. i in like manner would have my doctrine enter quietly into the minds that are fit and capable of receiving it; for confutations cannot be employed, when the difference is upon first principles and very notions and even upon forms of demonstration.\nxxxvi.\none method of delivery alone remains to us; which is simply this: we must lead men to the particulars themselves, and their series and order; while men on their side must force themselves for awhile to lay their notions by and begin to familiarise themselves with facts.\nxxxvii.\nthe doctrine of those who have denied that certainty could be attained at all, has some agreement with my way of proceeding at the first setting out; but they end in being infinitely separated and opposed. for the holders of that doctrine assert simply that nothing can be known; i also assert that not much can be known in nature by the way which is now in use. but then they go on to destroy the authority of the senses and understanding; whereas i proceed to devise and supply helps for the same.\nxxxviii.\nthe idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults.\nxxxix.\nthere are four classes of idols which beset men's minds. to these for distinction's sake i have assigned names, -- calling the first class idols of the tribe; the second, idols of the cave; the third, idols of the market-place; the fourth, idols of the theatre.\nxl.\nthe formation of ideas and axioms by true induction is no doubt the proper remedy to be applied for the keeping off and clearing away of idols. to point them out, however, is of great use; for the doctrine of idols is to the interpretation of nature what the doctrine of the refutation of sophisms is to common logic.\nxli.\nthe idols of the tribe have their foundation in human nature itself, and in the tribe or race of men. for it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things. on the contrary, all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe. and the human understanding is like a false mirror, which, receiving rays irregularly, distorts and discolours the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it.\nxlii.\nthe idols of the cave are the idols of the individual man. for every one (besides the errors common to human nature in general) has a cave or den of his own, which refracts and discolours the light of nature; owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature; or to his education and conversation with others; or to the reading of books, and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires; or to the differences of impressions, accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled; or the like. so that the spirit of man (according as it is meted out to different individuals) is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation, and governed as it were by chance. whence it was well observed by heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds, and not in the greater or common world.\nxliii.\nthere are also idols formed by the intercourse and association of men with each other, which i call idols of the market-place, on account of the commerce and consort of men there. for it is by discourse that men associate; and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar. and therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding. nor do the definitions or explanations wherewith in some things learned men are wont to guard and defend themselves, by any means set the matter right. but words plainly force and overrule the understanding, and throw all into confusion, and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies.\nxliv.\nlastly, there are idols which have immigrated into men's minds from the various dogmas of philosophies, and also from wrong laws of demonstration. these i call idols of the theatre; because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stage-plays, representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion. nor is it only of the systems now in vogue, or only of the ancient sects and philosophies, that i speak; for many more plays of the same kind may yet be composed and in like artificial manner set forth; seeing that errors the most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike. neither again do i mean this only of entire systems, but also of many principles and axioms in science, which by tradition, credulity, and negligence have come to be received.\nbut of these several kinds of idols i must speak more largely and exactly, that the understanding may be duly cautioned.\nxlv.\nthe human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds. and though there be many things in nature which are singular and unmatched, yet it devises for them parallels and conjugates and relatives which do not exist. hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles; spirals and dragons being (except in name) utterly rejected. hence too the element of fire with its orb is brought in, to make up the square with the other three which the sense perceives. hence also the ratio of density of the so-called elements is arbitrarily fixed at ten to one. and so on of other dreams. and these fancies affect not dogmas only, but simple notions also.\nxlvi.\nthe human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it. and though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side, yet these it either neglects and despises, or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects; in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate. and therefore it was a good answer that was made by one who when they showed him hanging in a temple a picture of those who had paid their vows as having escaped shipwreck, and would have him say whether he did not now acknowledge the power of the gods, -- \"aye,\" asked he again, \"but where are they painted that were drowned after their vows?\" and such is the way of all superstition, whether in astrology, dreams, omens, divine judgments, or the like; wherein men, having a delight in such vanities, mark the events where they are fulfilled, but where they fail, though this happen much oftener, neglect and pass them by. but with far more subtlety does this mischief insinuate itself into philosophy and the sciences; in which the first conclusion colours and brings into conformity with itself all that come after, though far sounder and better. besides, independently of that delight and vanity which i have described, it is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human intellect to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives; whereas it ought properly to hold itself indifferently disposed towards both alike. indeed in the establishment of any true axiom, the negative instance is the more forcible of the two.\nxlvii.\nthe human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly, and so fill the imagination; and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow, though it cannot see how, similar to those few things by which it is surrounded. but for that going to and fro to remote and heterogeneous instances, by which axioms are tried as in the fire, the intellect is altogether slow and unfit, unless it be forced thereto by severe laws and overruling authority.\nxlviii.\nthe human understanding is unquiet; it cannot stop or rest, and still presses onward, but in vain. therefore it is that we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world; but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond. neither again can it be conceived how eternity has flowed down to the present day; for that distinction which is commonly received of infinity in time past and in time to come can by no means hold; for it would thence follow that one infinity is greater than another, and that infinity is wasting away and tending to become finite. the like subtlety arises touching the infinite divisibility of lines, from the same inability of thought to stop. but this inability interferes more mischievously in the discovery of causes: for although the most general principles in nature ought to be held merely positive, as they are discovered, and cannot with truth be referred to a cause; nevertheless the human understanding being unable to rest still seeks something prior in the order of nature. and then it is that in struggling towards that which is further off it falls back upon that which is more nigh at hand; namely, on final causes: which have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe; and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy. but he is no less an unskilled and shallow philosopher who seeks causes of that which is most general, than he who in things subordinate and subaltern omits to do so.\nxlix.\nthe human understanding is no dry light, but receives an infusion from the will and affections; whence proceed sciences which may be called \"sciences as one would.\" for what a man had rather were true he more readily believes. therefore he rejects difficult things from impatience of research; sober things, because they narrow hope; the deeper things of nature, from superstition; the light of experience, from arrogance and pride, lest his mind should seem to be occupied with things mean and transitory; things not commonly believed, out of deference to the opinion of the vulgar. numberless in short are the ways, and sometimes imperceptible, in which the affections colour and infect the understanding.\nl.\nbut by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness, incompetency, and deceptions of the senses; in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it, though they be more important. hence it is that speculation commonly ceases where sight ceases; insomuch that of things invisible there is little or no observation. hence all the working of the spirits inclosed in tangible bodies lies hid and unobserved of men. so also all the more subtle changes of form in the parts of coarser substances (which they commonly call alteration, though it is in truth local motion through exceedingly small spaces) is in like manner unobserved. and yet unless these two things just mentioned be searched out and brought to light, nothing great can be achieved in nature, as far as the production of works is concerned. so again the essential nature of our common air, and of all bodies less dense than air (which are very many), is almost unknown. for the sense by itself is a thing infirm and erring; neither can instruments for enlarging or sharpening the senses do much; but all the truer kind of interpretation of nature is effected by instances and experiments fit and apposite; wherein the sense decides touching the experiment only, and the experiment touching the point in nature and the thing itself.\nli.\nthe human understanding is of its own nature prone to abstractions and gives a substance and reality to things which are fleeting. but to resolve nature into abstractions is less to our purpose than to dissect her into parts; as did the school of democritus, which went further into nature than the rest. matter rather than forms should be the object of our attention, its configurations and changes of configuration, and simple action, and law of action or motion; for forms are figments of the human mind, unless you will call those laws of action forms.\nlii.\nsuch then are the idols which i call idols of the tribe; and which take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit, or from its preoccupation, or from its narrowness, or from its restless motion, or from an infusion of the affections, or from the incompetency of the senses, or from the mode of impression.\nliii.\nthe idols of the cave take their rise in the peculiar constitution, mental or bodily, of each individual; and also in education, habit, and accident. of this kind there is a great number and variety; but i will instance those the pointing out of which contains the most important caution, and which have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding.\nliv.\nmen become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations, either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof, or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them. but men of this kind, if they betake themselves to philosophy and contemplations of a general character, distort and colour them in obedience to their former fancies; a thing especially to be noticed in aristotle, who made his natural philosophy a mere bond-servant to his logic, thereby rendering it contentious and well nigh useless. the race of chemists again out of a few experiments of the furnace have built up a fantastic philosophy, framed with reference to a few things; and gilbert also, after he had employed himself most laboriously in the study and observation of the loadstone, proceeded at once to construct an entire system in accordance with his favourite subject.\nlv.\nthere is one principal and as it were radical distinction between different minds, in respect of philosophy and the sciences; which is this: that some minds are stronger and apter to mark the differences of things, others to mark their resemblances. the steady and acute mind can fix its contemplations and dwell and fasten on the subtlest distinctions: the lofty and discursive mind recognises and puts together the finest and most general resemblances. both kinds however easily err in excess, by catching the one at gradations the other at shadows.\nlvi.\nthere are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity, others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty: but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean, neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients, nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns. this however turns to the great injury of the sciences and philosophy; since these affectations of antiquity and novelty are the humours of partisans rather than judgments; and truth is to be sought for not in the felicity of any age, which is an unstable thing, but in the light of nature and experience, which is eternal. these factions therefore must be abjured, and care must be taken that the intellect be not hurried by them into assent.\nlvii.\ncontemplations of nature and of bodies in their simple form break up and distract the understanding, while contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding: a distinction well seen in the school of leucippus and democritus as compared with the other philosophies. for that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure; while the others are so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature. these kinds of contemplation should therefore be alternated and taken by turns; that so the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive, and the inconveniences above mentioned, with the idols which proceed from them, may be avoided.\nlviii.\nlet such then be our provision and contemplative prudence for keeping off and dislodging the idols of the cave, which grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favourite subject, or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish, or out of partiality for particular ages, or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated. and generally let every student of nature take this as a rule, -- that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion, and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear.\nlix.\nbut the idols of the market-place are the most troublesome of all: idols which have crept into the understanding through the alliances of words and names. for men believe that their reason governs words; but it is also true that words react on the understanding; and this it is that has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistical and inactive. now words, being commonly framed and applied according to the capacity of the vulgar, follow those lines of division which are most obvious to the vulgar understanding. and whenever an understanding of greater acuteness or a more diligent observation would alter those lines to suit the true divisions of nature, words stand in the way and resist the change. whence it comes to pass that the high and formal discussions of learned men end oftentimes in disputes about words and names; with which (according to the use and wisdom of the mathematicians) it would be more prudent to begin, and so by means of definitions reduce them to order. yet even definitions cannot cure this evil in dealing with natural and material things; since the definitions themselves consist of words, and those words beget others: so that it is necessary to recur to individual instances, and those in due series and order; as i shall say presently when i come to the method and scheme for the formation of notions and axioms.\nlx.\nthe idols imposed by words on the understanding are of two kinds. they are either names of things which do not exist (for as there are things left unnamed through lack of observation, so likewise are there names which result from fantastic suppositions and to which nothing in reality corresponds), or they are names of things which exist, but yet confused and ill-defined, and hastily and irregularly derived from realities. of the former kind are fortune, the prime mover, planetary orbits, element of fire, and like fictions which owe their origin to false and idle theories. and this class of idols is more easily expelled, because to get rid of them it is only necessary that all theories should be steadily rejected and dismissed as obsolete.\nbut the other class, which springs out of a faulty and unskilful abstraction, is intricate and deeply rooted. let us take for example such a word as humid; and see how far the several things which the word is used to signify agree with each other; and we shall find the word humid to be nothing else than a mark loosely and confusedly applied to denote a variety of actions which will not bear to be reduced to any constant meaning. for it both signifies that which easily spreads itself round any other body; and that which in itself is indeterminate and cannot solidise; and that which readily yields in every direction; and that which easily divides and scatters itself; and that which easily unites and collects itself; and that which readily flows and is put in motion; and that which readily clings to another body and wets it; and that which is easily reduced to a liquid, or being solid easily melts. accordingly when you come to apply the word, -- if you take it in one sense, flame is humid; if in another, air is not humid; if in another, fine dust is humid; if in another, glass is humid. so that it is easy to see that the notion is taken by abstraction only from water and common and ordinary liquids, without any due verification.\nthere are however in words certain degrees of distortion and error. one of the least faulty kinds is that of names of substances, especially of lowest species and well-deduced (for the notion of chalk and of mud is good, of earth bad); a more faulty kind is that of actions, as to generate, to corrupt, to alter; the most faulty is of qualities (except such as are the immediate objects of the sense) as heavy, light, rare, dense, and the like. yet in all these cases some notions are of necessity a little better than others, in proportion to the greater variety of subjects that fall within the range of the human sense.\nlxi.\nbut the idols of the theatre are not innate, nor do they steal into the understanding secretly, but are plainly impressed and received into the mind from the play-books of philosophical systems and the perverted rules of demonstration. to attempt refutations in this case would be merely inconsistent with what i have already said: for since we agree neither upon principles nor upon demonstrations there is no place for argument. and this is so far well, inasmuch as it leaves the honour of the ancients untouched. for they are no wise disparaged the question between them and me being only as to the way. for as the saying is, the lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one. nay it is obvious that when a man runs the wrong way, the more active and swift he is the further he will go astray.\nbut the course i propose for the discovery of sciences is such as leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits, but places all wits and understandings nearly on a level. for as in the drawing of a straight line or a perfect circle, much depends on the steadiness and practice of the hand, if it be done by aim of hand only, but if with the aid of rule or compass, little or nothing; so is it exactly with my plan. but though particular confutations would be of no avail, yet touching the sects and general divisions of such systems i must say something; something also touching the external signs which show that they are unsound; and finally something touching the causes of such great infelicity and of such lasting and general agreement in error; that so the access to truth may be made less difficult, and the human understanding may the more willingly submit to its purgation and dismiss its idols.\nlxii.\nidols of the theatre, or of systems, are many, and there can be and perhaps will be yet many more. for were it not that new for many ages men's minds have been busied with religion and theology; and were it not that civil governments, especially monarchies, have been averse to such novelties, even in matters speculative; so that men labour therein to the peril and harming of their fortunes, -- not only unrewarded, but exposed also to contempt and envy; doubtless there would have arisen many other philosophical sects like to those which in great variety flourished once among the greeks. for as on the phenomena of the heavens many hypotheses may be constructed, so likewise (and more also) many various dogmas may be set up and established on the phenomena of philosophy. and in the plays of this philosophical theatre you may observe the same thing which is found in the theatre of the poets, that stories invented for the stage are more compact and elegant, and more as one would wish them to be, than true stories out of history.\nin general however there is taken for the material of philosophy either a great deal out of a few things, or a very little out of many things; so that on both sides philosophy is based on too narrow a foundation of experiment and natural history, and decides on the authority of too few cases. for the rational school of philosophers snatches from experience a variety of common instances, neither duly ascertained nor diligently examined and weighed, and leaves all the rest to meditation and agitation of wit.\nthere is also another class of philosophers, who having bestowed much diligent and careful labour on a few experiments, have thence made bold to educe and construct systems; wresting all other facts in a strange fashion to conformity therewith.\nand there is yet a third class, consisting of those who out of faith and veneration mix their philosophy with theology and traditions; among whom the vanity of some has gone so far aside as to seek the origin of sciences among spirits and genii. so that this parent stock of errors -- this false philosophy -- is of three kinds; the sophistical, the empirical, and the superstitious.\nlxiii.\nthe most conspicuous example of the first class was aristotle, who corrupted natural philosophy by his logic: fashioning the world out of categories; assigning to the human soul, the noblest of substances, a genus from words of the second intention; doing the business of density and rarity (which is to make bodies of greater or less dimensions, that is, occupy greater or less spaces), by the frigid distinction of act and power; asserting that single bodies have each a single and proper motion, and that if they participate in any other, then this results from an external cause; and imposing countless other arbitrary restrictions on the nature of things; being always more solicitous to provide an answer to the question and affirm something positive in words, than about the inner truth of things; a failing best shown when his philosophy is compared with other systems of note among the greeks. for the homoeomera of anaxagoras; the atoms of leucippus and democritus; the heaven and earth of parmenides; the strife and friendship of empedocles; heraclitus's doctrine how bodies are resolved into the indifferent nature of fire, and remoulded into solids; have all of them some taste of the natural philosopher, -- some savour of the nature of things, and experience, and bodies; whereas in the physics of aristotle you hear hardly anything but the words of logic; which in his metaphysics also, under a more imposing name, and more forsooth as a realist than a nominalist, he has handled over again. nor let any weight be given to the fact, that in his books on animals and his problems, and other of his treatises, there is frequent dealing with experiments. for he had come to his conclusion before; he did not consult experience, as he should have done, in order to the framing of his decisions and axioms; but having first determined the question according to his will, he then resorts to experience, and bending her into conformity with his placets leads her about like a captive in a procession; so that even on this count he is more guilty than his modern followers, the schoolmen, who have abandoned experience altogether.\nlxiv.\nbut the empirical school of philosophy gives birth to dogmas more deformed and monstrous than the sophistical or rational school. for it has its foundations not in the light of common notions, (which though it be a faint and superficial light, is yet in a manner universal, and has reference to many things,) but in the narrowness and darkness of a few experiments. to those therefore who are daily busied with these experiments, and have infected their imagination with them, such a philosophy seems probable and all but certain; to all men else incredible and vain. of this there is a notable instance in the alchemists and their dogmas; though it is hardly to be found elsewhere in these times, except perhaps in the philosophy of gilbert. nevertheless with regard to philosophies of this kind there is one caution not to be omitted; for i foresee that if ever men are roused by my admonitions to betake themselves seriously to experiment and bid farewell to sophistical doctrines, then indeed through the premature hurry of the understanding to leap or fly to universals and principles of things, great danger may be apprehended from philosophies of this kind; against which evil we ought even now to prepare.\nlxv.\nbut the corruption of philosophy by superstition and an admixture of theology is far more widely spread, and does the greatest harm, whether to entire systems or to their parts. for the human understanding is obnoxious to the influence of the imagination no less than to the influence of common notions. for the contentious and sophistical kind of philosophy ensnares the understanding; but this kind, being fanciful and timid and half poetical, misleads it more by flattery. for there is in man an ambition of the understanding, no less than of the will, especially in high and lofty spirits.\nof this kind we have among the greeks a striking example in pythagoras, though he united with it a coarser and more cumbrous superstition; another in plato and his school, more dangerous and subtle. it shows itself likewise in parts of other philosophies, in the introduction of abstract forms and final causes and first causes, with the omission in most cases of causes intermediate, and the like. upon this point the greatest caution should be used. for nothing is so mischievous as the apotheosis of error; and it is a very plague of the understanding for vanity to become the object of veneration. yet in this vanity some of the moderns have with extreme levity indulged so far as to attempt to found a system of natural philosophy on the first chapter of genesis, on the book of job, and other parts of the sacred writings; seeking for the dead among the living: which also makes the inhibition and repression of it the more important, because from this unwholesome mixture of things human and divine there arises not only a fantastic philosophy but also an heretical religion. very meet it is therefore that we be sober-minded, and give to faith that only which is faith's.\nlxvi.\nso much then for the mischievous authorities of systems, which are founded either on common notions, or on a few experiments, or on superstition. it remains to speak of the faulty subject-matter of contemplations, especially in natural philosophy. now the human understanding is infected by the sight of what takes place in the mechanical arts, in which the alteration of bodies proceeds chiefly by composition or separation, and so imagines that something similar goes on in the universal nature of things. from this source has flowed the fiction of elements, and of their concourse for the formation of natural bodies. again, when man contemplates nature working freely, he meets with different species of things, of animals, of plants, of minerals; whence he readily passes into the opinion that there are in nature certain primary forms which nature intends to educe, and that the remaining variety proceeds from hindrances and aberrations of nature in the fulfilment of her work, or from the collision of different species and the transplanting of one into another. to the first of these speculations we owe our primary qualities of the elements; to the other our occult properties and specific virtues; and both of them belong to those empty compendia of thought wherein the mind rests, and whereby it is diverted from more solid pursuits. it is to better purpose that the physicians bestow their labour on the secondary qualities of matter, and the operations of attraction, repulsion, attenuation, conspissation, dilatation, astriction, dissipation, maturation, and the like; and were it not that by those two compendia which i have mentioned (elementary qualities, to wit, and specific virtues) they corrupted their correct observations in these other matters, -- either reducing them to first qualities and their subtle and incommensurable mixtures, or not following them out with greater and more diligent observation to third and fourth qualities, but breaking off the scrutiny prematurely, -- they had made much greater progress. nor are powers of this kind (i do not say the same, but similar) to be sought for only in the medicines of the human body, but also in the changes of all other bodies.\nbut it is a far greater evil that they make the quiescent principles, wherefrom, and not the moving principles, whereby, things are produced, the object of their contemplation and inquiry. for the former tend to discourse, the latter to works. nor is there any value in those vulgar distinctions of motion which are observed in the received system of natural philosophy, as generation, corruption, augmentation, diminution, alteration, and local motion. what they mean no doubt is this: -- if a body, in other respects not changed, be moved from its place, this is local motion; if without change of place or essence, it be changed in quality, this is alteration; if by reason of the change the mass and quantity of the body do not remain the same, this is augmentation or diminution; if they be changed to such a degree that they change their very essence and substance and turn to something else, this is generation and corruption. but all this is merely popular, and does not at all go deep into nature; for these are only measures and limits, not kinds of motion. what they intimate is how far, not by what means, or from what source. for they do not suggest anything with regard either to the desires of bodies or to the development of their parts: it is only when that motion presents the thing grossly and palpably to the sense as different from what it was, that they begin to mark the division. even when they wish to suggest something with regard to the causes of motion, and to establish a division with reference to them, they introduce with the greatest negligence a distinction between motion natural and violent; a distinction which is itself drawn entirely from a vulgar notion, since all violent motion is also in fact natural; the external efficient simply setting nature working otherwise than it was before. but if, leaving all this, any one shall observe (for instance) that there is in bodies a desire of mutual contact, so as not to suffer the unity of nature to be quite separated or broken and a vacuum thus made; or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of resuming their natural dimensions or tension, so that if compressed within or extended beyond them, they immediately strive to recover themselves, and fall back to their old volume and extent; or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of congregating towards masses of kindred nature, -- of dense bodies, for instance, towards the globe of the earth, of thin and rare bodies towards the compass of the sky; all these and the like are truly physical kinds of motion; -- but those others are entirely logical and scholastic, as is abundantly manifest from this comparison.\nnor again is it a less evil, that in their philosophies and contemplations their labour is spent in investigating and handling the first principles of things and the highest generalities of nature; whereas utility and the means of working result entirely from things intermediate. hence it is that men cease not from abstracting nature till they come to potential and uninformed matter, nor on the other hand from dissecting nature till they reach the atom; things which, even if true, can do but little for the welfare of mankind.\nlxvii.\na caution must also be given to the understanding against the intemperance which systems of philosophy manifest in giving or withholding assent; because intemperance of this kind seems to establish idols and in some sort to perpetuate them, leaving no way open to reach and dislodge them.\nthis excess is of two kinds: the first being manifest in those who are ready in deciding, and render sciences dogmatic and magisterial; the other in those who deny that we can know anything, and so introduce a wandering kind of inquiry that leads to nothing; of which kinds the former subdues, the latter weakens the understanding. for the philosophy of aristotle, after having by hostile confutations destroyed all the rest (as the ottomans serve their brothers), has laid down the law on all points; which done, he proceeds himself to raise new questions of his own suggestion, and dispose of them likewise; so that nothing may remain that is not certain and decided: a practice which holds and is in use among his successors.\nthe school of plato, on the other hand, introduced acatalepsia, at first in jest and irony, and in disdain of the older sophists, protagoras, hippias, and the rest, who were of nothing else so much ashamed as of seeming to doubt about anything. but the new academy made a dogma of it, and held it as a tenet. and though their's is a fairer seeming way than arbitrary decisions; since they say that they by no means destroy all investigation, like pyrrho and his refrainers, but allow of some things to be followed as probable, though of none to be maintained as true; yet still when the human mind has once despaired of finding truth, its interest in all things grows fainter; and the result is that men turn aside to pleasant disputations and discourses and roam as it were from object to object, rather than keep on a course of severe inquisition. but, as i said at the beginning and am ever urging, the human senses and understanding, weak as they are, are not to be deprived of their authority, but to be supplied with helps.\nlxviii.\nso much concerning the several classes of idols, and their equipage: all of which must be renounced and put away with a fixed and solemn determination, and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed; the entrance into the kingdom of man, founded on the sciences, being not much other than the entrance into the kingdom of heaven, whereinto none may enter except as a little child.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

though he apologizes, this sets the tone for their relationship throughout the rest of the book and the next. c. j. morse, a reporter at nadine furst's station, calls eve afterwards, pestering her with details about the case and a possible connection to roarke. later, eve struggles between going back to her own apartment or roarke's house; she eventually gives in and goes to roarke's. at roarke's home, summerset greets her caustically, ironically remarking that he had no idea if she had intended to return. eventually, roarke joins eve in the bath, and tells her he loves her. eve does not reply; irritated, he changes the subject to the towers case and the fact that roarke has had business dealings with towers, which eve construes to be possibly illegal. roarke brings up eve's refusal to move in with him and commit to their relationship. later that night, while eve is sleeping, roarke reorganizes and sells all of his remaining illegal businesses. the next morning, c. j. morse implies that there is a cover-up involved in towers' death by eve and whitney. the extra publicity irritates eve, particularly because since naked in death and her relationship with roarke, she has unwillingly become very famous. it is another source of tension between her and roarke. afterwards, roarke leaves on business to australia and eve revenges herself against morse by feeding the towers story to nadine furst. eve goes to a club nearby the scene of the crime, the down and dirty. here she meets crack, the proprietor, who mistakes her for a stripper. he gives her enough information (for cash) to track down where towers had apparently scheduled a meeting. eve finds out that towers had had an umbrella that night, which was not recovered. ryan feeney has been unofficially instructed by the commander to aid the case. feeney comments on how glamorous eve looks in the media when out with roarke, then further prods by making cracks about how married they seem. later, nadine overhears roarke tell eve that he loves her and bothers her about it as well. eve is uncomfortable with roarke's feelings, feeling pressured to return them. after some non-progression in the case, eve returns to her own apartment; that night, roarke surprises her in her sleep, having returned from australia. the morning after, roarke is struggling to control his resentment over the fact that eve had not returned to his home. on their separate ways out, roarke presents eve with an enormous diamond that he bought impulsively at an auction in australia. terrified of what it represents, eve starts a fight with roarke, which he ends with an ultimatum for her to commit fully to their relationship. at towers' funeral are her children, david and mirina angelini, their father, and oddly enough, morse. also at the funeral is roarke, who tells eve that mirina's fiance is hiding a gambling and prostitution scandal. eve researches it and discovers that roarke sold the casino where it took place the day after towers' death. roarke refuses to tell her that he did it for her. another victim is found, murdered by the same mo, an actress named yvonne metcalf, whose shoe is missing. c. j. morse is already on the scene, filming the woman's dead body. he snidely informs eve that metcalf used to have a relationship with roarke. unable to find any connections between the victims, eve heads to dr. charlotte mira's office; mira tells eve that the killer hates women and wants to be famous, hence going after women who have what he wants. mira also points out that these two women had a connection with roarke; offended, eve asks her if she thinks that roarke is the killer. mira tells eve that she is not in love with a murderer. eve tells her that she's having flashbacks of her time in dallas. after trying to relax, eve heads to roarke's house, bypasses summerset by elbowing him, and makes her way to roarke's office, ostensibly to interview him about metcalf. the two have a hostile interview; finally, eve turns to leave. roarke locks the door, but before he can say anything, eve turns to him, shows that she's wearing the diamond (which she will wear underneath her clothing for the rest of the series), tells him that she'll move in with him, and that she loves him. eve tells roarke that the killer is stalking famous women. he is unhappy to find that eve has decided to capitalize on this by becoming bait. nadine promises to help this by delivering as much media attention as possible, but the scheme doesn't work. roarke, who has to leave on another business trip, surprises eve with her own suite of the house, which he has converted (partly with furniture from her apartment) into her own home office, adjoining his. eve has a surfeit of leads: randall slade's gambling debts, david angelini's (towers' son) business failures and own gambling debts, and a mysterious transfer of two hundred thousand dollars from mrs. whitney to david. the commander is furious when she and feeney tell him they have to interview his wife. upset, she returns to what is now her and roarke's home and invites mavis over. mavis's arrival shocks summerset (whom eve led to believe that she was inviting over another man), but surprisingly enough, he likes mavis very much and for the rest of the books, is unusually kind and attentive to her. that night, one of nadine's editors, louise kirski, goes out in nadine's hooded raincoat and is murdered; c. j. morse finds her body. at the scene of the crime is officer delia peabody, the attending. it becomes quite clear that nadine was the intended victim. security tapes show that david angelini was at the scene of the crime; further research reveals that he had a failed business deal with yvonne metcalf. during interview, he tries to bribe her; he also says that he had seen louise kirski get murdered before running away. believing him the murderer but without physical evidence, she arrests him for some minor charges. whitney asks her to release david on his own recognizance, but she denies him; he tells her she lacks compassion and dismisses her. a search of angelini's house uncovers a long-handled blade spotted with blood; after seeing the knife, marco angelini falsely confesses to the murder, in an attempt to take the blame for his son. however, he sticks to his story in interview, even when whitney personally interrogates him. whitney finally realizes the stress and anger he's subjected eve to and tries to alleviate the situation, and after mirina angelini interrupts them, he tries to apologize, but eve rejects it and leaves. eve and roarke have a night in mexico; on their return, eve finds that the lab has tested david's knife as being negative for the murder weapon. the new police chief, harrison tibble, tells her to release david and marcus on lack of evidence. he adds that that there is too much emotion involved in this case, lightly censuring both her and whitney. afterwards, eve finds out that nadine is missing. eve reviews morse's police interview and realizes that he lied about how he found louise kirski's body. further research incriminates him as having possibly murdered his mother. at the studio, however, morse is missing. eve requests peabody as her backup, and they search morse's apartment, where peabody finds the missing umbrella and shoe. waiting for news on morse or nadine, eve is stuck at roarke's fundraiser when summerset informs her of a private call, which turns out to be morse, holding nadine hostage. he gives her six minutes to make it to central park; she leaves without telling anyone, and when roarke realizes that eve is gone, he replays eve's last call and leaves to follow her. during the fight with morse, eve miscalculates and gives him the upper hand. before he can kill her, roarke intervenes and saves her, and the knife instead stabs morse in the throat. (it is not clear whether or not this was accidental or intentional on roarke's part.) roarke proposes to eve as they walk away from the scene. in immortal in death, morse is supposedly standing trial for his murder when he's very clearly dead at the end of this book. part of immortal in death supposedly takes place in may, which is impossible as it is june at the end of this book.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

{"id": 6091, "text": " june 30, 2008: boxer santaros (dwayne johnson) wakes up alone in the nevada desert, he takes out a red syringe and injects himself in the neck. he begins walking through the desert. fortunio balducci (will sasso) is on a houseboat with tab taverner-former mayor of hermosa, his son ronald taverner (seann william scott) nephew, jimmy hermosa and friend, krysta now (sarah michelle gellar). fortunio is currently in an online-poker game with several american soldiers in syria and loses, but the connection is lost because the soldiers were attacked\u2014which means fortunio is still going to lose his money. fortunio owes some bookies in las vegas $100,000 so tab suggests that fortunio get out of nevada before the holiday weekend begins; this should buy him some time. fortunio can\u2019t get across the border because he has no interstate visa to get across and will take sometime for him to get one. krysta now tells fortunio that she can get him a visa and to meet her at a bar called buffalo bill\u2019s situated at the border. fortunio leaves the boat and drives towards the border. on his way, he finds boxer passed out on the road. he pulls over and approaches him. boxer stirs and says: \u2018i am a pragmatic prevaricator, with a propensity for oratorical seniority, which is too pleonastical to be expeditiously assimilated by any of your unequivocal veracities.\u2019 fortunio puts him inside the car and they begin to drive off again. fortunio asks boxer how and what he was doing out in the middle of the desert. boxer doesn\u2019t know and asks the date. he seems to suffer from amnesia. at the same time, a nevada park ranger is tipped off about the whereabouts of an abandoned suv with a burned-up dead body inside. the suv is a prototype vehicle belonging to treer which is powered by \u2018fluid karma\u2019. the vehicle and corpse is taken away to a facility nearby. the facility is broken into by armed-men, killing everyone inside and taking the suv and corpse. fortunio asks boxer if he can remember anything. the only thing he seems to remember is a maze made of sand. fortunio says that he is a big fan of boxer\u2019s. boxer is confused and doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. fortunio tells him that he is boxer santaros-a very famous action star and ex-pro-football player. he then tells him of the incidents that occurred on july 4, 2005. the two make it to buffalo bill\u2019s where krysta now is performing on stage but instead of stripping, she begins to sing poetry. fortunio explains the situation to krysta, that he found boxer lying in the desert, picked him up and that he has amnesia, so now he needs two visas. krysta will get the visas on one condition-play along a game she has created. using boxer\u2019s amnesia to her advantage, she will tell boxer that the two of them were together in vegas for the weekend, partying and working on a script that she wrote called \u2018the power\u2019, she was researching a character at buffalo bill\u2019s (her character in the movie is an intelligent dancer interested in astrophysics). she then goes on to say that fortunio has to pretend that he is a private detective and was hired to find boxer and bring him to krysta, if he doesn\u2019t do it, she will deliver him to the bookies in vegas. she ends up convincing the naive boxer. apparently, the script (\u2018the power\u2019) was written solely by krysta, and that boxer never had anything to do with it to begin with, but she has convinced him that he is starring in and directing the film. he asks what it is about and who he plays. krysta says that boxer plays a renegade l.a.p.d. cop called jericho kane and that it revolves around the end of the world. she gives him a copy of the script to read. krysta begins talking to fortunio outside her hotel room. she tells him to contact a lawyer and have him draw up a short form contract for himself for \u2018the power\u2019 and to give himself $100,000 to settle his debt with the bookies. while boxer is reading the script, the phone begins to ring. he answers and the woman on the other end tells him: \u2018is this the pragmatic prevaricator?-stay with the girl, she is your only chance for survival, we saw the shadows of the morning light, the shadows of the evening sun, until the shadows and light were one. cross the border at dawn, stay with the girl, and whatever she says, keep taking the injections, and whatever you do-do not board the roller coaster.\u2019 krysta enters the room and asks about the script. boxer says he likes it but there is lots of work to be done on it. later, boxer signs the contract given to him by fortunio and krysta. he goes to get a check from the bank, he places his thumb on the scanner, which is fed back to us-ident (who are looking for boxer). boxer tells krysta about the phone call and of his dream in the desert; she was in his dream and he remembers the song she sang in buffalo bill\u2019s in the dream. she tells him that they have to ride the roller coaster across the road from buffalo bill\u2019s. boxer is hesitant at first but agrees. he takes an injection before they go on. once they get to the top, boxer has a vision...a vision of 1902, a native-america tribe standing there. boxer waves at one of them. he seems to have created a rupture in the fourth dimension. he goes back to 2008 all of a sudden and he tells krysta about his vision. the two of them exit the roller coaster together.... the book takes on a classical literature type of story, the title, \"two roads diverge\" is from a famous poem by robert frost. the cover from the book has a quote from t. s. eliot, stating that our world will not go out with a bang as we expect, but with a whimper. june 30, 2008: ronald taverner is still on the houseboat with his father and cousin. we learn that he is suffering from amnesia. his father, tab, brings him below deck to show him something. down there is his twin brother-roland taverner, he is tied up to a chair. tab tells him that ronald kidnapped his own brother to hide him up at the lake for several days. his father tells him that he doesn\u2019t remember it because he hit his head, which caused memory loss and he instructs him to keep taking the injections. his brother roland was drafted in the iraqi war and was sent home to work for the u.p.u. (urban pacification unit) and uncovered a conspiracy and if the government found him, they would get the information out of him. they need ronald to impersonate roland for several days as a part of a mission to destroy us-ident. he is to meet with a woman named zora carmichaels (cheri oteri)-a neo-marxist (a member of the revolution against us-ident) in venice beach. zora takes ronald and the tied-up roland to los angeles. july 1, 2008: boxer santaros and krysta now finally arrive in los angeles. they and fortunio balducci (now a producer due to the contract signed in buffalo bill\u2019s) visit a friend of krysta\u2019s named tawna mcbride for research on the script. she tells boxer to remain in character the entire time. inside, tawna tells krysta that her husband, rick, died recently due to a drug overdose, with the same syringe that boxer had. boxer shows her the syringe he has and tawna asks where he got it from and asks whether or not he volunteered for the program. rick was in the army and volunteered for a top-secret program and that the weeks leading up to his death, rick began to act crazy, wandering off into the desert in the middle of the night saying that he was going to see the chief. this makes boxer feel unpleasant so he goes to use the bathroom. inside the bathroom, a character in the mirror begins talking to boxer . he keeps asking boxer: \u2018do you bleed?...not like we do future-man\u2019. boxer asks who the indian is. the man says that the indian is a natural bleeder and that it took long to make contact, he took a shot of fluid karma (the name of the substance inside the syringes), the indian is a natural bleeder (he sees forward in time) and the man in the mirror and boxer are chemical bleeders (they see back in time) but when chemical bleeders take fluid karma too much, they begin to see both ways...this is why the man in the mirror is seeing into the future-at boxer. he is 6 months behind in january 2008. the man asks if is he sleeping with tawna and asks where he is. he then begins to recognize boxer and his films. the man in the mirror is rick, tawna\u2019s husband. boxer tells him that he is dead. rick doesn\u2019t believe him and he takes a shot of fluid karma and he then falls to the ground and dies. boxer comes rushing out telling tawna that he saw her husband die and that he was a part of it. she becomes very upset and she kicks them out of her house. boxer then faints and falls onto the ground... boxer seems to be dreaming, he is in a big maze. all of a sudden, a giant snake appears from behind him and it begins to chase boxer around the maze. boxer runs up a set of stairs and into a portal. he lands on the other side and sees ronald standing there. ronald asks boxer who he is...boxer calls himself \u2018jericho kane\u2019. all of a sudden, ronald wakes up from his dream. he is still with zora in her van driving into los angeles. he begins to describe the dream for her. in the treer plaza, inga von westphalen and two fellow scientists are discussing an experiment that they are conducting (several people involved in it is the taverner twins and boxer). boxer was apparently guided to krysta for a reason (which we don\u2019t know yet). krysta was part of the experiment also because of her psychic abilities. they believe that her script \u2018the power\u2019 is a \u2018guide map for the experiment\u2019 and a work of prophecy. they administered fluid karma into krysta\u2019s system, hypnotised her and also had her read the entire book of revelation, then they told her to create a document that would detail the final three days on earth before the apocalypse. inga gets a telephone call from zora, who tells her that ronald has experienced his first \u2018fluid karma dream\u2019. krysta takes boxer and fortunio to a barnyard outside of los angeles, where many neo-marxists are attending a huge party. they meet up with jimmy hermosa who leads them into his tattoo parlour. krysta tells boxer that this is where he will become jericho kane. he is getting numerous tattoos all over his body. at the same time ronald and zora arrive at the barn and she introduces ronald to dream and dion (the leaders of the neo-marxist movement). moments later, boxer santaros is introduced to the crowd, who cheer wildly. ronald is shocked...it\u2019s jericho kane from his dream. july 2, 2008: madeline frost santaros (mandy moore) (daughter of the current senator) calls her father and tells him that boxer santaros has been missing for several days. she and boxer were married for several years. if word got out of his disappearance, it would effectively ruin senator bobby frost\u2019s chances of being re-elected. june 27, 2008: boxer and madeline are at a charity scavenger hunt sponsored by treer. they are guests of honour at it. before they go out on stage, madeline gets pissed off as to why they would be associating with a nut-job like baron von westphalen. but vaughn westhouse (hollywood advisor to the elliot-frost campaign and boxer's agent) gets her to get out on stage or he will tell boxer that she is having an affair with her assistant - brandt huntington. boxer goes out on stage and talks about the scavenger hunt, whoever finds the last mechanical ball (remote antennas for the energy fields) buried underneath the ground will win a brand new suv powered by fluid karma. a person is at the area where the first ball is buried and where boxer is expected to arrive with the first clue. the person\u2019s mission is to kidnap boxer and abandon him in the desert. july 3, 2008: back at the treer plaza, general teena macarthur was inspecting the body found in the burnt-up suv, so she calls a long friend named simon theory (kevin smith) to help her. ronald taverner, zora carmichaels, dream and dion are having breakfast at their restaurant. he wants them to bring himself and his brother to a hospital, believing that there is something wrong with both of them. the neo-marxists explain their plan to ronald. they show him \u2018the power\u2019 script. they are going to get him to go on a ride-along with boxer for preparation and research for his character. dion and dream are going to stage a dispute that ronald will have to go investigate and pretend to shoot them both dead...and all on boxer\u2019s video camera. at fortunio balducci\u2019s house, he is reading the script when serpentine (a mistress of the baron\u2019s) calls him and tells him to facilitate a meeting between ronald taverner and boxer and in return she will pay him for it. at the neo-marxist hq, roland taverner is tied up and injected with fluid karma. the unconscious roland begins singing all these things that i've done-the killers. they inject him once more and he stops. ronald finds a letter belonging to his brother from someone called pilot abilene. he asks zora what he was. she tells him that he was an actor in a comedy troupe and he met zora, dion and dream where they became \u2018the lighthouse gang\u2019. pilot abilene is a former soldier who is now a guard of the generator dubbed \u2018utopia three\u2019 at the santa monica pier. he was an actor who started out in an action movie with boxer santaros. the film was very bad but he became well-known from it, but his career ended when he was drafted to iraq. it was here where he met roland and the two became best friends. they learn of an experiment called \u2018serpentine dream theory\u2019-all they know is if they sign up for it, you are used as a guinea pig but soon after, you are sent home. they go one night to visit simon theory (who is in charge of the experiment). he says no at first, saying that it isn\u2019t for volunteers, but changes his mind once they bribe him. the next morning they are taken to a nearby airbase and each given an injection of fluid karma. the next day, the two are about to drop in from a helicopter. pilot is nervous about it so roland gives him his ipod to listen to during the drop...the song is \u2018all these things that i have done\u2019. they drop successfully and they infiltrate a building where their telepathy kicks in...the drug is working on them. roland is in a state of dementia, so he throws a grenade into a room, which explodes right next to pilot, which sends shrapnel into the left side of his face. they never saw each other after that day. the neo-marxists are holding another meeting, this time a lottery for thumbs (certain people will be selected to have their thumb cut off to rig the election, they can re-use the same thumb as many times as possible, turning the election in their favour). ronald, zora, dion and dream are in attendance. the winner is bing zinneman who receives a check for $50,000 and then had his thumb cut off his hand. afterward, krysta now and her friends and colleagues sheena gee, shoshanna cox and deena storm are in the middle of a conversation. krysta tells her three colleagues that she booked a gig on the mega-zeppelin for the baron on july 4th. while this is happening, boxer is walking the beaches of venice during the night. he takes out the fluid karma syringe and injects himself...before he loses conscious, he murmurs \u2018three days...three final days\u2019... after krysta leaves the bar where she was talking with her friends, she is cornered by fortunio. he tells her to tell him everything about \u2018serpentine dream theory\u2019. she says that serpentine is \u2018the great mistress of the great wizard\u2019 who some call the anti-christ...

{"id": 6097, "text": " wimsey accepts an offer from the highly respectable management of pym's publicity, ltd. (a light disguise for s. h. bensons, where sayers worked) to investigate a mystery and avert a scandal. copywriter victor dean has died in a fall down the spiral iron office staircase, but he left a half-finished letter to the management hinting that something potentially scandalous is going on at pym's. under the pseudonym of \"death bredon\" (actually his middle names), wimsey goes to work at pym's. he takes over dean's office and learns his trade while investigating the office staff. he discovers a talent for copywriting and promotion, and produces a campaign which will become one of the firm's most successful. he also investigates dean's social life. dean, for a short time, socialized with \"the demomerie crowd\": the cronies of dissolute socialite dian de momerie, most of them heavy cocaine users. he met de momerie's companion, major milligan, who appears to be the cocaine supplier for the group. milligan is linked to a big cocaine-selling ring which wimsey's friend and brother-in-law chief inspector parker is investigating. milligan, hearing that dean worked at pym's, spoke to him assuming that dean was the ring's man at pym's. dean was surprised, and milligan shut up - but dean guessed that someone else at pym's was involved. hence the letter to management. wimsey plays multiple roles. by day he is bredon, a distant, impoverished wimsey cousin who works for a living. most evenings, he is himself. but on some evenings, \"bredon\" dresses up as a masked harlequin, and by various wild stunts draws the attention and company of dian de momerie - annoying major milligan. junior newspaper reporter hector puncheon has a beer in a pub, and discovers later that someone put a bag of cocaine in his coat pocket. he must have blundered into a distribution operation, but there's no further sign of anything at that pub. apparently the ring holds each week's distribution at a different location. wimsey continues his probing at pym's, and learns that one of the senior copywriters, tallboy, seems to have large amounts of cash. puncheon recognizes a man who was in the pub the night he was given the cocaine, and follows him. puncheon gets knocked out, and the man \"accidentally\" falls in front of a moving train. the dead man (mountjoy) had money but no job or assets, which fits a drug dealer. his effects include a telephone book with the names of many pubs ticked off. one of the marked pubs is the one where puncheon was given the cocaine. other clues turn up: a scarab in dean's desk, a large pebble in the stairwell, a \"catapult\" (slingshot) belonging to office boy ginger joe, who is recruited by \"bredon\" to help in the investigation. finally wimsey makes the connection. one of pym's major clients runs a large newspaper advertisement every friday morning. the text is approved a few days earlier. the first letter of the advertisement's text indicates the pub to be used that week. tallboy supplies the letter to the ring as soon as the text is approved. a final clue turns up during a company social outing, in the course of a cricket match between pym's and brotherhood's, a soft-drink company and pym's client. most of the players are middle-aged and flabby. but wimsey, provoked by a ball which clips his elbow, shows off the form which made him a first-team star at eton and oxford. tallboy too shows a surprising talent, when he knocks down a wicket with a perfect throw from deep in the field. wimsey wins the match for pym's, which is about to expose his cover when the police, led by parker, arrest \"bredon\" for the murder of dian de momerie. milligan is dead too - killed in yet another \"accident\" as the ring covers its tracks. but the ring is still operating, and the police want to nab the whole gang at their next distribution. with mountjoy's phone book, all they need is the letter for the week - which is provided by ginger joe. while \"bredon\" supposedly sits in jail, \"lord peter\" is much seen about town for the next few days. the roundup comes off as planned, but the death of victor dean remains unsolved. that night, tallboy comes to wimsey's flat and confesses. he was sucked into the scheme with a innocent-sounding story and the offer of money he needed. but soon he was trapped. then dean found out and blackmailed him. tallboy shot him in the head with ginger joe's catapult on the staircase, so it would look like an accident. tallboy he cannot escape, and suggests suicide, which would save his family from the shame of his trial and conviction for murder. wimsey, after looking out of the window, has an alternative: tallboy must go home, on foot, and never look behind him. both know that the gang's killers are waiting in ambush.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

{"id": 6106, "text": " the book opens with an extract from the book of dreams, which contains the imaginative writings of howard alan treesong during his unhappy childhood. among other things, it details the adventures of seven paladins, who are key to the fantasy world he devises. gersen's pursuit of treesong begins after a conversation with an interworld police coordinating commission (ipcc) contact, who remarks that the arch criminal has been quiet as of late. some years earlier, he made himself \"lord of the overmen\" (or \"king of thieves\" in less grandiose language) and as recently as three years ago, he almost engineered his appointment as head of the ipcc itself. gersen and his friend grudgingly admire treesong's ambition to control the criminal underworld and the oikumene's sole interstellar police agency at the same time. gersen concludes that treesong must be due for another grand gesture any time soon, but admits to himself he possesses insufficient imagination to visualize what it could be. his extensive business empire, managed by jehan addels, includes cosmopolis magazine, for which he often masquerades as the journalist \"henry lucas\". gersen spends some time examining the cosmopolis files for any material relating to treesong. he is on the point of giving up when he discovers a photograph, apparently of a formal dinner, bearing the words \"h a treesong is here\". no other likeness of treesong is known to exist - and the woman who had sold it to the magazine had apparently been killed for it. but there is no way to tell which of the people in the picture is treesong, so gersen devises a plan to unmask him. he launches extant, a livelier sister magazine to cosmopolis. he then publishes the picture in the free inaugural issue as part of a contest, offering large cash prizes to anyone who can first identify any or all of the ten people in the photograph. an attractive red-haired young woman, alice wroke, seeks temporary employment processing the contest entries. gersen, expecting an attempt at infiltration by treesong, covertly uses a lie detector on her and confirms his suspicions. eventually, each of the subjects is identified, except for one man who seems to have a variety of identities. when a contestant submits the correct identification for all ten, gersen confronts alice and places most of his cards on the table: that the photograph was intended to identify treesong, and that the magazine would be interested in interviewing him. however, he conceals his personal interest. information from the contest leads gersen to suspect the photograph is of the highest-ranking fellows of the powerful institute. it includes seven members of the \"dexad\" (the fellows of ranks 101 to 109 and 111), and the three fellows of rank 99 (ranks 100 and 110 are always vacant). all save one died at the banquet, poisoned by charnay (see below). the survivor is the man of many names - treesong himself, clearly the murderer of the others. having fraudulently acquired the rank of 99, he plans to become the institute's leader, the triune (rank 111, hence the name), by default. three members of the dexad were not present. one had died recently: the banquet was for choosing his successor from the 99s. another had broken with the institute and become a hermit. the last was alice wroke's father; treesong, under a false name, blackmailed alice into spying on the contest by threats to her father, whom he had in fact already murdered. gersen locates the last surviving member of the dexad just ahead of treesong, and saves him, in the process shooting treesong in the leg. the new triune immediately cancels treesong's spurious rank and brings to an end another plan that would have put the demon prince in a position of immense power. extant receives a late entry to the contest, from someone who identifies treesong as \"howard hardoah\" from maunish on the planet mouderveldt and claims to be his father. the letter also mentions a school reunion, to which howard has been invited. treesong himself calls the extant offices, and identifies the people in the photograph, only to be told that all have been named already, and that he is too late to claim a prize. \"henry lucas\" offers to publish treesong's memoirs, but treesong says he has somewhere to go immediately. gersen suspects that treesong plans to attend the school reunion. gersen travels to maunish. he interviews the elder hardoah, with the excuse of delivering a prize check, and learns about treesong's boyhood. he also meets howard's older brother ledesmus, who hid howard's prized \"book of dreams,\" an exercise book in which he wrote his childhood fantasies, and tells of howard's near-murder of his childhood friend nymphotis cleadhoe, when he thought nymphotis had taken it. ledesmus recovers the book and sells it to gersen. gersen contacts treesong's one-time music teacher, and pays for his orchestra's appearance at the reunion - with gersen as a member, though an afternoon's lesson leaves him a thoroughly inept musician. his guess is correct. treesong arrives, accompanied by a band of menacing underlings, and perpetrates imaginative (though non-fatal) humiliations on those who had tormented him. treesong's admittedly good musical ear is offended by gersen's poor playing, so he has him thrown out. out of sight, gersen dispatches the men assigned to take him away and uses their weapons. this is enough to disrupt treesong's revenge, but gersen can do no more than inflict another wound before he has to flee. in a second interview with the hardoahs he learns that the cleadhoes moved off-planet, and their destination. otho cleadhoe was township marmelizer - who transformed the flesh of corpses into a stony substance, after which the resulting \"marmel\" (statue) was placed in the cemetery. he still has the book, and finds there a description of treesong's \"seven paladins\". on broaching the subject with alice, who is now his confederate, he learns that treesong considers the seven to be the embodiments of various aspects of his own personality, with \"immir\" representing normal self. gersen concludes that the book would probably lure treesong out of hiding. he finds willing, but difficult, allies in nymphotis cleadhoe's parents, otho and tuty - whose only child is dead, and they have no doubt that howard killed him. gersen has cosmopolis publish a sensationalized report of treesong's exploits at the reunion, and a letter purportedly from tuty, in which she talks fondly of howard as their son's friend, and casually mentions an exercise book she still has in her possession. as hoped, this draws treesong's attention. the cleadhoes now live on the jungle planet of bethune preserve. treesong comes in search of his precious book. tuty and otho lure treesong to their remote outpost, but double-cross gersen, leaving him (and alice) behind. gersen and alice manage to borrow a vehicle to follow in, but arrive late. they are shown into otho's laboratory and museum. otho has marmelized treesong's legs, and left him seated in an indoor garden facing the marmel of nymphotis. gersen reveals his motivation for seeking the last demon prince's downfall. the arch-villain wearily acknowledges himself to have been neatly trapped, mourns the narrow failure of his attempt to make himself the first emperor of the gaean worlds, and asks to be left alone. gersen declines to take any further revenge on him and leaves with alice and the cleadhoes. from behind the door, gersen overhears a conversation, as between immir/treesong and his paladins, in which the lesser paladins bid farewell to their leader and gradually convince him that the situation is truly hopeless. before they \"depart\", the paladins perform one last service for immir. a crash and a splash are heard; gersen hurries back inside, to find treesong face down and drowned in a pond, before the overturned chair, though he should have been unable to rise from it and it had been solidly secured. gersen, his revenge complete, finds himself at a loss. he confesses to alice that he does not know what he will do now that he has been deserted by his enemies.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

{"id": 6120, "text": " the book is set in 1137. brother cadfael is introduced, working in the herb gardens of shrewsbury abbey. a welshman who has been on crusade before joining the order of saint benedict in middle life, he has far more worldly experience than most of his brother monks. he has two young monks to assist him in his work; john, who is practical and down-to-earth, and columbanus, who is ambitious and sanctimonious. one morning, columbanus is taken ill with what some take to be the \"falling sickness\" (epilepsy) but which cadfael reckons to be a hysterical fit. brother jerome, clerk to the ambitious prior robert, prays over columbanus during the night and announces the next day that a young woman appeared to him and told him to take columbanus to st winefride's well in north wales. when they return, columbanus is recovered. he in turn says that saint winefride appeared to him and stated that her grave at gwytherin in north wales had long been neglected, and she desired to be interred somewhere more accessible to pilgrims. neither cadfael nor john believe the tales. prior robert is known to have been searching for some time for a suitable saint's relics to grace shrewsbury abbey. robert, the lazy sub-prior richard, jerome and columbanus prepare to journey to wales to retrieve winefride's remains. cadfael induces abbot heribert to send him with them, as a fluent welsh-speaker will be required, and john, to do the menial work. the bishop of bangor and owain gwynedd, prince of gwynedd, give their assent, and the monks reach gwytherin, a community stretching for several miles along the cledwen river. the local priest, father huw, is hospitable, but objects to winefride's remains being removed without first calling an assembly of the free men of the parish. when it is held the next morning, rhisiart, the most influential landowner in the community, opposes the saint's removal. prior robert makes a misguided attempt to bribe him. rhisiart storms off, announcing that he is implacably opposed to robert. the assembly breaks up, with every man agreeing with rhisiart. robert and jerome take the view that rhisiart is committing blasphemy, but father huw persuades robert to appeal to rhisiart for another meeting. at the house of cai, rhisiart's ploughman, john talks to annest, the niece of bened the blacksmith, and they quickly fall in love despite the difference in language. rhisiart meanwhile does not change his views, but agrees to meet prior robert at huw's house at noon the next day. the next morning robert tells john to make himself useful to the servants and sends jerome and columbanus to pray at winefride's chapel while he, richard, cadfael and huw wait for rhisiart. rhisiart does not appear. when he has been missing for some hours, a search is mounted, and he is found dead in some dense woods, apparently shot from in front with a bow and arrow. the arrow bears the mark of engelard, an englishman who has fled into wales to avoid punishment for poaching, and who is in love with rhisiart's daughter sioned. when engelard appears, many locals insist that he had motive to kill rhisiart. at robert's insistence, they prepare to take him into custody. on the spur of the moment, engelard flees, and brother john impedes the only local man close enough to stop him. robert furiously orders john to be held for breaking the law of gwynedd and his own vow of obedience. since he is to be held at rhisiart's house, where he will have contact with annest, john meekly complies. cadfael meanwhile realises that engelard's arrow did not kill rhisiart. it had rained for an hour about noon. rhisiart's back, on which he lay, is damp, while his front is dry. rhisiart was stabbed from behind, by a dagger which penetrated through his body, and fell face down. some time later, after it rained, someone turned him over and pushed the arrow into the wound from the front. for the moment, cadfael can only speculate why anyone would do this. although the monks from shrewsbury all appear to have alibis for the time of rhisiart's death, columbanus confesses the next morning to sleeping rather than praying all the previous day, making jerome a suspect. father huw tells robert that his flock have taken rhisiart's death as an omen and no longer oppose winefride's removal. robert declares that he will exhume the remains only after three nights' vigil and prayer. cadfael takes advantage of the superstition that a corpse will bleed afresh if touched by the murderer (though he does not believe it himself, having seen men who died in battle being handled by those who killed them). at his suggestion, sioned asks that after each night's prayer, the two who maintained the vigil place their hand upon rhisiart's heart in token of forgiveness. on the first morning, jerome appears to hesitate, but eventually does as sioned asks. the next night, robert excuses himself from the vigil on the pretext of relating the recent events to prince owain's bailiff. on the third night, cadfael and columbanus share the vigil, but columbanus once again has a fit of religious ecstasy and is carried off unconscious in the morning. he recovers after mass, and relates that winefride appeared once again to him and said that rhisiart should be buried in her grave when she is removed. they begin digging out winefride's grave. cadfael finds the body several feet down, and the monks carefully place it in the coffin brought from shrewsbury. prior robert places wax seals on the coffin to prevent anyone from disturbing the contents. as they prepare to bury rhisiart in her place, sioned asks peredur, another young man who has been in love with her, to place a jewelled cross on the body. peredur refuses, terrified, and claims that rhisiart cannot accuse him. he confesses that he found rhisiart dead and pushed one of engelard's arrows into the wound, thinking that engelard would flee into england and thus remove himself as rival for sioned's hand. shocked by these revelations, peredur's mother branwen becomes hysterical. cadfael had previously prepared a flask of a tranquilising syrup derived from poppies, in case of further hysterical fits by columbanus. he retrieves it from columbanus's belongings and finds most of it is gone, though enough remains to calm branwen. he then recalls that on the day of rhisiart's murder, columbanus confessed to sleeping while at vigil, but only jerome drank some of the wine provided for sustenance. had it been laced with the syrup, jerome would almost certainly have slept through the vigil, but would have been ashamed to admit it. cadfael is distracted from this train of thought by the news that the prince's bailiff is about to take john into custody. when the bailiff arrives at sioned's dwelling, he is met by cai, who is wearing a bloodstained bandage and says that john broke free after striking him with a board. though robert is displeased, the bailiff, cai, bened and annest all seem rather complacent over the escape. on the last night before the monks depart, columbanus, who sioned and cadfael reckon is taking the glory of the translation of the saint for himself, offers to mount another solitary vigil. as he believes himself to be unobserved, he composes himself to sleep. he is awakened by the vision of a young woman demanding to know why he murdered rhisiart, her champion. unnerved, columbanus confesses and begs forgiveness from the saint, saying that the deed was for her glory. as she calls him a liar, columbanus realises that the \"saint\" is actually sioned, and slashes at her with a knife, inflicting only a graze, before fleeing. cadfael and engelard tackle him outside the chapel. seeing sioned bleeding from her wounds, an enraged engelard hurls columbanus to the ground hard enough to break his neck. faced with this unexpected development, cadfael recalls sioned's inspired words about rhisiart being her champion. he, engelard, and sioned quickly undress columbanus, open st. winifrede's coffin, replace the remains of the saint in her grave above rhisiart's body, and place columbanus's naked body in the coffin. cadfael uses his knowledge of seals (and, more importantly, how to inconspicuously break them) to give the appearance that the coffin remained undisturbed. the three then prepare the chapel for discovery in the morning. the next morning, columbanus's shirt and habit are found empty on the floor of the chapel. hawthorn petals are scattered around them. though some wonder whether columbanus has gone mad and is wandering naked, robert proclaims that columbanus's prayers to be taken from the world into a state of grace have been answered. the villagers help load the saint's suspiciously heavy coffin aboard a cart without any outward sign that anything is wrong, yet cadfael suspects that every one of them knows what happened during the night. as they leave gwytherin, john can be seen (by cadfael) bidding them farewell. two years later, bened, the smith from gwytherin, calls at shrewsbury abbey while on a pilgrimage to walsingham. he tells cadfael that john and annest are married, and john will become the smith after bened. sioned and engelard are also married, and have christened their first child cadfael. to robert's chagrin, he relates that what robert fondly imagines to be saint winefride's former resting place in gwytherin is the scene of many pilgrimages and miraculous cures, when the ornate tomb in the abbey is treated with indifference by pilgrims and apparently the saint herself. cadfael is left musing that the saint is unlikely to object to sharing a grave with rhisiart.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

and next morning he was placed under the guidance of joshua geddes. the quaker, who was part owner of some fishing nets in the river, invited him to spend a few days at his house; and while there he heard from alan that a young lady had called to warn him that his friend was in considerable danger, and to urge that he should at once return to edinburgh. a letter, however, from old mr fairford determined him not to do so; and having made acquaintance with the blind fiddler, who told him a tale of the redgauntlet family, darsie went with him to a fishers' merry-making, where he danced with lilias, who reproached him for leading an idle life, and begged him to leave the neighbourhood. mr fairford had arranged that peter peebles, an eccentric plaintiff, should be his son's first client, and alan was pleading the cause before the lords ordinary when his father, by mistake, handed him a letter from mr crosbie, announcing that darsie had mysteriously disappeared. alan instantly rushed out of court, and started in search of his friend, who had accompanied the quaker to await an attack on his fishing station, and been made prisoner by the rioters, of whom mr herries was the leader. after being nearly drowned, and recovering from a fever, he awoke in a strange room, to which he was confined for several days, when he was visited by his captor, and conducted by him to an interview with squire foxley, who, acting as a magistrate, declined to interfere with mr herries' guardianship. as the squire was leaving, however, mr peebles arrived to apply for a warrant against alan for throwing up his brief, and startled mr herries by recognising him as a redgauntlet and an unpardoned jacobite. darsie obtained a partial explanation from him, and was told to prepare for a journey disguised as a woman. meanwhile, alan had applied to the provost, and, having obtained from his wife's relation, mr maxwell, a letter to herries, he started for annan, where, under the guidance of trumbull, he took ship for cumberland. on landing at crakenthorp's inn, he was transported by nanty ewart, and a gang of smugglers, to fair-ladies' house, where he was nursed through a fever, and introduced to a mysterious father buonaventure. after being closely questioned and detained for a few days, he was allowed to return with a guide to the inn. darsie was also travelling thither with herries and his followers, when he discovered that lilias, who accompanied them, was his sister, and learnt from her his own real name and rank. he was also urged by his uncle to join a rising in favour of the pretender; and, having hesitated to do so, was detained in custody when they reached their destination, where alan, as well as other visitors and several of the neighbouring gentry, had already arrived. he was then introduced to a conference of charles edward stuart's adherents, and afterwards to the prince himself, who refused to agree to their conditions, and decided to abandon the contemplated attempt in his favour. ewart was, accordingly, ordered to have his brig in readiness, when nixon suggested that he should turn traitor, upon which they fought and killed each other. sir arthur now learned that fairford and geddes were in the house; but, before he was allowed to see them, they had been shown into the room where lilias was waiting, when alan became aware that his fair visitor at edinburgh was his friend's sister, and heard from her lips all the particulars of her brother's history. their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of benjie, in whose pocket a paper was found indicating that nixon had communicated with the government; and, during the confusion which ensued, the hanoverian general campbell arrived, unarmed and unaccompanied, and after explaining that the jacobites had been betrayed weeks before, announced that he was sufficiently supported with cavalry and infantry. the rebellion was over before it could begin. his instructions, however, from king george were to allow all concerned in the plot to disperse, and he intimated that as many as wished might embark in the vessel which was in waiting. the pretender was, accordingly, led by the laird of redgauntlet to the beach, and lilias offered to accompany her uncle in his voluntary exile. this, however, he would not permit, and, after an exchange of courtesies with the general, the prince departed amidst the tears and sobs of the last supporters of his cause, and henceforward the term jacobite ceased to be a party name. lilias, of course, married alan, and herries, who had asked his nephew's pardon for attempting to make a rebel of him, threw away his sword, and became the prior of a monastery.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

mrs. comstock wants elnora to remain at home and work as a drudge on their farm. lack of money for tuition and books nearly derail her continued enrollment. her few comforts are the fact that she knows she can excel in school, especially in math and her study of nature; the kindness of her neighbours, wesley and margaret sinton; that freckles left her a valuable specimens box in the swamp; and that she succeeds in her enterprising scheme to gather and sell artifacts and moths from the limberlost, which she can store in freckles's box without her mother's knowledge. elnora is smart and witty, and she loves the outdoors; her heart aches for returned love. she soon makes many friends at school. eventually elnora wins her mother's love, but only after a few emotional disasters have stricken the comstock women. firstly, after succeeding in high school for some years, she feels a yearning to play violin, as her father had done. margaret sinton is able to procure for her the very same violin that robert comstock used to play, and elnora becomes proficient at it. she knows that her mother hates the violin, without knowing why, so she must conceal her proficiency. secondly, when elnora is in her final year of high school, wesley and margaret insist that katharine accompany them to the high school play. katharine has no interest in seeing \"what idiotic thing a pack of school children were doing.\" but katharine is curious about the high school; she enters it to deride it, then finds she admires it; when she hears a violin playing, she enters the school play and discovers elnora playing \"as only a peculiar chain of circumstances puts it in the power of a very few to play.\" upon seeing elnora playing her dead husband's violin to an enthusiastic audience, and realizing that her world has changed irrevocably - \"the swamp had sent back the soul of her loved dead and put it into the body of the daughter she resented, and it was almost more than she could endure and live\" - katharine faints. thirdly, a few days later, elnora believes her mother understands the necessity for her to graduate so that she can enter college or, at least, teach, either of which she would love to do. she instructs katharine that she will need new dresses for commencement and trusts her mother to supply them. mrs. comstock, always antagonistically honest, presents her with an old dress. elnora considers this an unforgivable betrayal, a sign of her mother's disregard and lack of love for her. that night, elnora must find a good dress elsewhere. fourthly, elnora has always concealed from her mother the fact that she can earn money by selling moths. as she works through her final year of high school and hopes to go to college, she finds that there is a single moth she must collect, which will pay the way for her future. in the central conflict of the novel, elnora sees her mother destroy that moth. when she protests, mrs. comstock slaps her. elnora has always been patient, but now she screams that she hates her mother and rushes out. mrs. comstock, finally realizing how essential elnora is to her stable home life, sets out that night to replace the moth. she worsens the situation, a result which elnora hides from her, but when the sintons discover that mrs. comstock hit elnora, margaret determines on an intervention. she tells katharine that she has been mourning for a husband who was promiscuous and planning to cheat on her. with this news, katharine understands how she has neglected a loving, talented daughter. elnora graduates and is now 19 years old. a young man, philip ammon, arrives in town. his uncle, a doctor, advised phillip has been sent to onabasha to recuperate from typhoid fever. he stays with elnora and her mother for a summer and helps elnora gather moths. the two gradually fall in love; however, he is already engaged to another young woman, edith carr, who is wealthy, spoiled, and self-centered. elnora, to pretend that she is not beinning to fall for philip, helps him to write letters to edith carr and in every way encourages his marriage to his childhood friend. when philip, after daily, prolonged conversation and fieldwork discovers his romantic interest in elnora is growing, mrs. comstock is the first to notice, but he assures her, \"i admire her as i admire any perfect creation.\" mrs. comstock replies, \"and nothing in all this world spoils the average girl so quickly and so surely.\" philip ammon is forced to return to chicago when his father is ill, and begs of elnora a farewell kiss; she refuses him and returns to her mother, broken-hearted. philip and edith have an argument at what was supposed to be their engagement party. edith insults him terribly and calls their engagement off (not for the first time). she has heard philip talk about a wonderful young lady he met in the limberlost. philip leaves home and proposes to elnora. on the very afternoon that he gives elnora an engagement ring, edith drives up, with some friends, to the comstocks' home, in an unasked-for visit. when edith demands to speak to elnora privately and swears that elnora will never take philip from her, elnora is cool and polite. when edith's group leaves, elnora secretly takes off, giving edith the chance to prove that philip would marry no one else. philip becomes ill with worry about elnora, and edith's friend hart persuades her to admit that she is wrong and that philip will marry no one except elnora. in the denouement, it is implied that edith will marry hart, just as philip will marry elnora.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

earth. with the help of bartleby\u2019s tracking ability, they discover that there is someone else down there with them, but are attacked by giant carnivorous creatures called spider-monkeys. they are saved by the intervention of a new character called martha. she takes them to where she lives, a shack evidently built by the survivors of a galleon which was sucked down the another of the giant

then there follows a parting of the ways as mrs burrows remains on the surface with drake, who has asked will to return back into the earth and make sure that the risk of the dominion virus has been neutralised. will is accompanied by his father as they retrace the their route to where the submarine was blasted from the ledge in \"smoking jean, and he is reunited with chester, martha, and a fully recovered elliott. departure (part 6) drake, with help from a squad of former sas soldiers, devises a plan to trap one of the leading styx, the \u201cold styx\u201d, using mrs burrows as bait. but the mission fails and mrs burrows is captured and taken to the colony where she is darklit. meanwhile, dr burrows, in a literal leap of faith, throws himself into the pore, followed by his son, and eventually by elliott and bartleby. dr burrows\u2019 assumption that the gravity further down the pore is progressively lower is proved to be correct, and after locating the submarine, they search for any surviving styx. dr burrows, driven by his conviction that there is a world at the centre of the earth, risks all their lives as he makes sure that they have no option but to continue towards it. they finally make it through to the \u201cgarden of the second sun\u201d - a hidden world at the centre of the earth, complete with its own sun, mountains, oceans, and animals long since extinct on the surface. assisted by will, dr burrows begins to investigate one of three mayan-type pyramids they find there, and it seems as though they are finally safe from the styx until elliott spots some footprints. she, will and bartleby follow the trail and discover that the rebecca twins and a limiter have also made it through to the hidden world. after elliott sets an ambush to deal with the styx for once and for all, will disobeys her and sneaks in to retrieve the dominion phials. he is discovered by one of the rebecca twins, and in the firefight and explosion which follow, both the rebecca twins and limiter perish, while will makes off with the phials. far from being angry at his disobedience, will\u2019s reward is a kiss on the cheek from elliott. it seems as though will\u2019s prayers have been answered as he embarks upon his new life in this idyllic world, with elliott as his companion and working with his father to discover incredible secrets from the past, until one day dr burrows spots a ww2 german bomber, a stuka, in the sky.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

husband, and several associates, who incompetently attempt to coerce severn into providing classified information. they are interrupted by hegemony security personnel, who arrest severn's captors, revealed by gladstone as royalists with connections to the shrike cult. severn next observes meetings of both the hegemony cabinet and gladstone's inner circle, updating gladstone on the hyperion pilgrims while still pretending to be an artist. suddenly, while touring several farcaster-connected worlds between meetings, gladstone is informed that the ousters have counterattacked, attacking the worldweb itself in an unprecedented and unexpected move that appeared impossible. since force strategic reserves have been committed to the war in the hyperion system, the first wave of worlds threatened by the ouster invasion seem destined to fall. severn tours several of the worlds, narrowly escaping from a rioting mob that recognizes him as one of gladstone's associates. as sudden shrike cult uprisings devastate major hegemony planets, keats travels to pacem, the homeworld of the catholic church, where he encounters father dur\u00e9. dur\u00e9 had disappeared from hyperion after entering the planet's underground labyrinth, and was escorted by the shrike through various places and finally to pacem, where he sought out his old confidante, monsignor edouard, and described the events that he experienced in the past years. dur\u00e9, intrigued by the collusion of the templar brotherhood with the shrike cult, travels to god's grove, the brotherhood's home and soon to be within the range of the ouster invasion armada. severn, accompanied by gladstone's aide leigh hunt, farcast to tau ceti center, but instead arrive on a world that is an apparent analog of 19th century earth and, in particular, the city of rome, where the historical keats died. like the original keats, severn contracts tuberculosis and his physical form dies, but his persona retreats into the computerized realities of the technocore. the consul meets with the leaders of the ouster swarm attacking hyperion, which is on the verge of falling to the siege. he is tried for the murder of the ouster agents he killed years previously, but is not punished, his sentence being to live during the turbulent times that the ousters believe shall follow the war. the consul is then informed that there is no ouster offensive against the worldweb, and concludes that the technocore is the only power capable of launching such an attack. the ousters then offer their support to the hegemony in their struggle against the artificial intelligences of the technocore, but only in the form of retaliation for the fall of the hegemony, which they claim is inevitable since the ousters refuse to use farcasters. gladstone, who has resolved to use a technocore device against the ousters while hegemony citizens temporarily evacuate and retreat into the labyrinths of the worlds containing those features, is sent this information, and also discovers that a force autopsy of ouster bodies found during a failed counterattack against the invasion armada reveals that the \"ousters\" are truly technocore \"cybrids.\" gladstone retires for a brief time, and, while napping, is approached by severn in a dream. having met with his creator, ummon, severn has discovered that the technocore resides within the farcaster system, fearing alien intelligences (lions and tigers and bears) to be found in the void which binds, a reality thought of by the hegemony as a communications medium. gladstone orders the immediate destruction of the farcaster network, knowing that, despite the inevitable death and chaos that will follow this action, it would cause a cessation of technocore activity. she does so, and resigns as chief executive. back on hyperion, brawne lamia, who has awakened from her coma-like state, penetrates the shrike palace to find silenus and all of the other victims of the shrike connected via a long cable. she manages to free silenus, just as the shrike appears and prepares to attack her. she mysteriously manages to freeze the shrike as it advances, and it falls over a precipice and shatters. meanwhile, sol's daughter rachel appears in a newly-formed body outside the time tombs as a young woman, carrying her younger self (now aging normally again). giving her younger form to sol, she explains that she is moneta, and is now traveling back in time with the shrike under orders from humanity's future. she disappears and sol decides to go forward in time to rachel's future using the portal. elements of force discover that the technocore invasion has suddenly ceased, and that the invasion armada lacks any personnel whatsoever. throughout the former worldweb, chaos breaks out, with shocked hegemony citizens turning to violence. on tau ceti center, government house is besieged by a furious assembly of citizens. gladstone allows herself to be killed by the demonstrators, remaining on the planet even after her de jure successor, senator gabriel kolchev, flees. the story concludes several months later; the worst of the chaos caused by the fall has abated, and hyperion is flourishing again, with former hegemony citizens and ousters co-existing. newly substantiated glyphs give some insight to the various tombs and monoliths of the time tombs, and, rarely, the portal to the future will admit a person. the novel ends with the consul returning to the former web worlds in his starship to discover what happened, with severn's artificial intelligence stored in his ship.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

only to become chased by every man in the fort, its owner taking advantage of the situation to claim the theft of a non-existent fortune. he escapes to hule, where he finds refuge in a camp. a man named ghend arrives there a short time later and presents althalus with a proposition. ghend hires althalus to travel to the \"house at the end of the world\" to steal a book. although he suspects something is amiss, althalus accepts the job and heads there. after several days of travel he finds the house and manages to stumble upon the book, only to realize that the house is occupied by a talking cat who has trapped him. after several days of being trapped he finally decides to listen to the cat and thus finds out several astonishing things. the book is called the \"book of deiwos\", deiwos being the god who created the world, and the cat (named emerald or emmy by althalus) teaches him to read it. after two and a half thousand years, emerald reveals to althalus that the book can be used to accomplish feats of magic. the intervening two millennia have seen many changes in the world, including the initial stages of an ice age triggered by the evil god daeva. emerald tells althalus that ghend is daeva's agent, and is working to establish daeva as the ruler of the world. the cat and althalus set out to gather a party of people who are destined to save the world from daeva's dominion. they try to find the knife which will guide them to each person.having arrived at the knife's depository, they are told that the knife has been taken by eliar, a member of the army. with this new information they travel to osthos, where eliar seems to have become a slave. deciding that they will have to buy off all the slaves, the two travel to emerald's private gold mine and collect twenty blocks of gold, which althalus converts into coins. with their purses full, they return and meet andine, the queen of osthos, in her palace, posing as slavers. however, andine won't sell eliar to them. emerald worms her way into andine's affection in an attempt to persuade her to give up eliar.finally, the queen (or \"arya\") agrees to sell the other slaves along with eliar. with the deal struck, althalus leads his troupe out, but overhears eliar planning on attacking him with the other soldier slaves. to break the soldier's loyalty, he randomly picks a soldier and sends him several thousand feet into the air before bringing him back down and releasing the slaves, except eliar, whom he keeps chained up. in the morning, eliar decides that he will follow althalus. after buying some horses they head to awes, where emerald tells eliar that he must show the writing on the knife to every priest in awes and ask if they can read it. while doing this they discover an agent of daeva, who screams in anguish after seeing the knife. eliar quickly slays him and they hide the body under a pile of rocks. unfortunately, a young priest finds them, but it turns out that the priest is none other than the fourth member of their party, bheid. with their new member ready, emerald \"reads\" the knife, which leads them back to osthos, where their fifth member is destined to be none other that the queen of osthos: andine. returning to osthos, they camp out behind the walls of the city for the night. formulating a plan, althalus and emerald sneak into andine's palace unnoticed. in her chambers, emerald captures andine in a spell, causing her to be little more than a puppet. leading their newest member out of the city, they rejoin their group and decide to hastily leave before morning comes and andine is discovered missing. unfortunately, andine wants no part in this and focuses on killing eliar, but the enchantment on the knife forces her to listen to althalus, and so, with their newest member in tow, the party travels to hule, to find their sixth member. while traveling towards hule, bheid tries to quell andine's hatred towards eliar - with limited success, it but appears to be taking effect when andine refrains from making any scathing remarks towards eliar. during the night, althalus and eliar hear someone sneaking towards their camp and capture the boy named gher, who, it turns out, is their sixth member.emerald finally sorts out the problems with andine by using gher as a voice, andine (having a change of heart) helps clean up the beaten up gher and they head to kweron to find their final member; a \"witch\". in kweron, althalus and emerald hatch up a scheme that involves bheid; bheid will pretend that he has come to collect the \"witch\" for interrogation, as well as predicting avalanches and lightning strikes (which althalus will provide). bheid is, at first, reluctant to so lie that blatantly about something, but in the end, he agrees. after a conversation with the priests of the village, he finds out that the \"witch\" is about to be burned alive. through the respect he has gathered by his \"forecasts\", he can convince the priests to give the enigmatic leitha into his care. before leaving, leitha reveals that she can \"hear\" the thoughts of other people. the group decides to travel back to the house at the end of the world. dweia reveals the origins of why they must do what they do: deiwos, the sky god - and dweia's brother - created the world, and filled the planet with living things, whom dweia cares for. however, daeva's only role is to destroy parts of the universe, but only those which deiwos and dweia allow him to. daeva tries to change this, and has ghend find each member of his \"chosen ones\" to prepare to take over the world, and to do this he needs deiwos's book, to copy it and make a book of his own for this purpose. after learning this, althalus introduces emerald, who in reality was dweia all along, to the \"family\" and quickly explains the situation to them as well as telling them about eliar's ability to use the doors of the house to travel through spacetime. after getting acquainted with living in the house, they use the doors to return to arum where they try to win albron's (the knife keeper's) clan as allies, and show him the house as an act of trust. they know that they will need an army to combat gelta's archaic forces from the past. calling a clan meeting they hire all the arum clans and prepare themselves to fight against gelta's army. thanks to the more modern warfare of their time, gelta's forces are easily crushed and, although eliar is injured, with the help of to althalus's powers, the remaining part of the enemy forces is defeated. ultimately, ghend and althalus face off in the house at the end of the world, ending with the destruction of the book of daeva, the defeat of daeva, and the saving of the universe. fr:la r\u00e9demption d'althalus nl:de kronieken van de eerste ijstijd ja:\u30a2\u30eb\u30b5\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u8d16\u7f6a fi:althalus: matka maailman \u00e4\u00e4riin sv:tjuven althalus", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

(he is separated from his venal wife and her children \u2014 of whom he is only legally, not biologically, the father. he supports them but does not see them, and has no ambition because if he earns more money, his wife will demand it.) helen's health deteriorates because of her belief in pen's immoral connection with fanny. pen finally discovers how helen treated fanny; he is very angry at his mother and tells her he and fanny are innocent. she is overjoyed to hear it, and soon mother and son forgive each other. helen's health is nevertheless too much shaken and she dies soon after. pen thus comes into possession of the family property of 500 pounds a year. he leases his house at fairoaks to tenants and returns to london while laura goes to live as companion to a lady rockminster. pen does send a small amount of money to fanny bolton with his thanks. she eventually marries a mr. huxter (who had started the gossip about her and pen!). major pendennis, still hoping to arrange a profitable marriage between pen and blanche amory, meets sir francis and threatens to divulge his secret \u2014 that he is not really married to lady clavering \u2014 if sir francis will not retire and turn over his seat in parliament to pen. sir francis consents. major pendennis's shrewd valet morgan overhears the conversation and makes plans to extort everyone \u2014 the major, pen, altamont, sir francis, and lady clavering. when morgan tries this on major pendennis, however, the major won't stand for it, as he has as much to threaten morgan with (theft) as morgan has to threaten others with. at this point, pen has finally become engaged to blanche though they do not love each other. then he learns, through morgan, of the scandal concerning the claverings. pen does what he considers the honorable thing: he maintains his engagement with blanche, but refuses her family money and the seat in parliament. now henry foker comes back into the picture: his father has died and his fiancee-cousin ann has eloped with another man, leaving harry rich and free to marry as he likes. he returns to england and immediately proposes to blanche. she accepts because he is richer than pen. on learning that blanche has broken their engagement, pen proposes to laura, whom he has come to love, and is accepted, because she has long loved him \u2014 even when she refused his first marriage proposal. the secret of the clavering family finally becomes known to everybody and henry foker breaks his engagement to blanche \u2014 not because of her disreputable father but because she deceived him and doesn't love him. there is one final surprise: altamont/amory, although he is blanche's father, was bigamously married to several women before he \"married\" blanche's mother, so the clavering marriage is legal after all \u2014 but blanche is illegitimate. blanche leaves for paris where she apparently marries a con man. foker remains unmarried. pen and laura marry and soon their income increases and he enters parliament through his own honest efforts.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

{"id": 6375, "text": " according to ilan papp\u00e9, the 1948 palestinian exodus consisted of the forced relocation of close to 800,000 palestinians. this was more than half of the palestinian population at that time. it also involved the destruction of 531 palestinian villages, and the emptying of 11 entire palestinian urban neighborhoods. the event is referred to, by palestinians, as the nakba, the catastrophe. the thesis that papp\u00e9 presents is that the nakba was a calculated and intentionally executed ethnic cleansing perpetrated by zionist israelis. he states, with emphasis, that there is no room for ambivalence in this matter. his references include zionist quotations and writings, military and political archives, and the diaries of david ben-gurion. his intent is also to explore how the denial of the nakba has been so successful for so long. his views are in direct opposition to mainstream israeli versions of the relocation, which claim that the relocation was 'voluntary'. in his preface, ilan papp\u00e9 says, 'such a painful journey into the past is the only way forward if we want to create a better future for us all.' papp\u00e9 states that the ethnic cleansing idea was first expressed in early zionist writings. for example, in 1917, leo motzkin stated 'the colonization of palestine has to go in two directions, jewish settlement\u2026and the resettlement of the arabs.' in 1938 david ben-gurion stated, 'i am for compulsory transfer; i do not see anything immoral in it.' then in 1948, according to ilan papp\u00e9, the ethnic cleansing was implemented by david ben-gurion, yigael yadin, moshe dayan, yigal allon, yitzhak sadeh, moshe kalman, moshe camel, yitzak rabin, shimon avidan, rehavam zeevi, yitzhak pundak, and others. the ideological drivers of the campaign were ben-gurion's close advisers whom ilan papp\u00e9 calls the 'consultancy group'. the implementers were officers who led attacks executed by the haganah (an israeli militia) and the irgun (another israeli militia), the stern gang (another israeli militia), and the israeli defense force. the details of the \"ethnic cleansing strategy\" are fully described in an israeli military/government document entitled plan dalet. plan dalet, according to papp\u00e9, spells out, in writing, the clear directives of the operation. it included 'bombarding villages\u2026setting fire to homes, properties and goods, expulsion, demolition and planting mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled inhabitants from returning.' this chapter focuses on the definition of ethnic cleansing in terms of ethics and international law and international agreements. papp\u00e9 refers to the united nations commission on human rights, the united states department of state, and the international criminal court for sources of discussion. he also describes the short-lived support that the u.s. gave to the palestinians by endorsing united nations general assembly resolution 194, which calls for the return of the displaced palestinian refugees. papp\u00e9 states that, 'later on, the expelled are then erased from the country's official and popular history and excised from its collective memory.' he concludes that there is no denying that this alleged ethnic cleansing has been most successfully erased from conventional israeli history. papp\u00e9 states in this chapter that a key ingredient in the zionist creation of an israeli state was such that it would be created exclusively for jews. the muslim control of palestine had lasted for 1300 years prior to the british mandate. zionism emerged in the 1880s largely through the writings of theodore herzl. the zionist movement had been growing steadily by the time that britain took control of palestine after world war i. on october 31, 1917 the balfour declaration occurred. 'lord balfour gave the zionist movement his promise\u2026to establish a national home for the jews in palestine.' palestinians made up 80\u201390 percent of the population of palestine in the 1920s. as a result of the balfour declaration, yosef weitz began a remarkably thorough demographic study of the palestinian villages. his study is called the village files. it was later used for key strategic information needed to implement the ethnic cleansing of palestine. this chapter also includes a history of the impact of the british military operations in suppressing the palestinian uprisings in 1929 and in 1937. the uprising in 1937 was particularly significant in that, according to papp\u00e9, the british so thoroughly defeated the palestinians that their future ability to fight for their rights to their homeland was strategically impacted. britain provided key training for the haganah and the irgun. david ben-gurion stated, 'the arabs will have to go.' ben-gurion's strategy for the creation of the israeli state included very specific offensive military steps. they are described in plans a, b, c, and d. 'the purpose of such actions would be to deter the palestinian population from attacking jewish settlements, and to retaliate for assaults on jewish houses, roads, and traffic. plan c spelled out clearly what punitive actions would entail, such as * killing the palestinian leadership. * killing palestinian inciters and their financial supporters. * killing palestinians who acted against jews. * killing senior palestinian officers and officials. * damaging palestinian transportation. * damaging the sources of palestinian livelihoods: water wells, mills etc. attacking nearby palestinian villages likely to assist in future attacks. * attacking palestinian clubs, coffeehouses, meeting places, etc.' plan dalet (plan d) called for the systematic and total expulsion of palestinians from their homeland. here papp\u00e9 recalls that in 1947 the united nations special committee on palestine called for the creation of two states and the united nations general assembly passed resolution 181 stating so. the palestinians immediately rejected this. then david ben-gurion's group of close advisors, that papp\u00e9 calls the consultancy, began its planning to deal with the palestinian resistance. plan d (plan dalet) was adopted on march 10, 1948. it called for, amongst many things, the initial uprooting of 250,000 palestinians. this initial uprooting represented the beginning of the actual execution of plan dalet. key negotiations between israel and jordan had led to the jordanian promise to not join any all-arab military operations against the jewish state. the agreement 'neutralized the strongest army in the arab world.' the british departed palestine on 15 may 1948. haganah had 50,000 trained troops. the implementation of plan dalet continued in earnest. the deir yassin massacre occurred. in it, 93 palestinians were killed. soon after, four more villages were taken. they were qalunya, saris, beit surik, and biddu. the united states offered a scheme to stop the bloodshed by first establishing a three-month cease-fire and then developing a trusteeship plan in five years. both ideas were rejected by the israelis. ben-gurion had stated \"only a state with at least 80% jews is a viable and stable state\" and that palestinians 'can either be mass arrested or expelled; it is better to expel them.' papp\u00e9 states that many palestinian villages such as dayr ayyub, beit affa, and khisas had virtually no defense mechanism of any kind. the attack on balad al-shaykh occurred leaving 60 palestinians dead. the hawassa neighborhood in haifa was evacuated. the sarraya house in jaffa was bombed leaving 26 dead and the samiramis hotel in qatamon was bombed leaving many others dead. papp\u00e9 refers to yosef weitz again, a member of the consultancy. weitz had stated, 'the only solution is to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries. not a single village or a single tribe must be left off.' in this chapter, papp\u00e9 describes various cities, and villages, and the operations to cleanse them. operation naschon was the first operation of plan dalet. it specifically called for the destruction of palestinian villages in april 1948. it was the first time that the various israeli militias would operate together as a unit and become the israeli defense force. papp\u00e9 states 'the arab governments did little beyond airing their inflammatory war rhetoric in all directions so as to hide their inaction and unwillingness to intervene on behalf of the palestinians.' the united nations plan had allocated haifa, the only port of the country, to be granted jewish control. mordechai maklef as the operation officer of the carmeli brigade, issued orders to 'kill any arab you encounter; torch all inflammable objects and force doors open with explosives'. crowds of defenseless palestinians ran down the streets of haifa to the port to escape on any boat they could find. 'many [boats] turned over and sank with all their passengers'. the next cities to fall were acre, nazareth and safad. papp\u00e9 states that the arab liberation army was never a match against the well organized israeli forces. according to papp\u00e9, there was never serious arab liberation army strength, so 'the falsity of the myth of a jewish david facing an arab goliath' was very clear. as jerusalem was cleansed, 'british inaction was the rule.' in april 1948 the cleansing of jerusalem began. 'all in all, eight palestinian and thirty nine villages were ethnically cleansed in the greater jerusalem area.' after the battle was won by the israeli haganah, 50,000 palestinians were forced to leave jaffa. by 15 may 1948 200 palestinian villages were occupied and their people expelled. this chapter discuses the dual nature of the 1948 conflict particularly during may 1948. on one hand there was the arab israeli war and on the other hand there was the ethnic cleansing. in a letter that david ben-gurion sent to the commanders of the haganah brigades he stated, 'the cleansing of palestine remained the prime objective of plan dalet.' papp\u00e9 states that the arab war efforts were 'ineffective', and 'pathetic'. the most intensive arab efforts occurred in the first three weeks of the war. ethnic cleansing was conducted in at least 64 villages by the israeli alexandria brigade according to papp\u00e9 they were also part of the massacre at tantura, per ilan papp\u00e9, on may 2, 1948. he quotes from various witnesses that as many as 230 were massacred there. various other brigades such as the golani brigade, carmeli brigade, kiryati brigade, harel brigade, bulgarian brigade, yiftach brigade, and givati brigade also conducted cleansing operations. papp\u00e9, in this chapter, discusses june through september 1948. the ethnic cleansing continued despite the passage of the universal declaration of human rights through the united nations general assembly resolution 217a(iii) david ben-gurion's diary june 5, 1948 states, 'the cleansing operation continues.' eliezer kaplan, the minister of finance authorized the confiscation of all palestinian properties already taken. papp\u00e9 states that numerous palestinian villages had been peacefully occupied by muslim, druze, and christians for centuries. on july 18, 1948 another truce was organized by the u.n. mediator count folke bernadotte. papp\u00e9 states, 'in less than two weeks, hundreds of thousands of palestinians had been expelled from their villages, towns, and cities.' papp\u00e9 begins this chapter with quotes from the badil resource center. 'in 1948, 85% of the palestinians living in the areas that became the state of israel became refugees.' 'it is estimated that there were more than 7 million palestinian displaced persons at the beginning of 2003.' he talks about operation hiram, war crimes during the operation, mopping up operations, israel's anti-reparation policy, final cleansing of the south and the east, and the massacre in dawaymeh. papp\u00e9 states 'i have no illusion that it will take more than this book to reverse a reality that demonizes a people who have been colonized, expelled, and occupied, and glorifies the very people who colonized, expelled and occupied them.' papp\u00e9 starts this chapter with another set of quotes about ethnic cleansing, including, 'since 1967, israel has detained 670,000 palestinians.' sections of this chapter are entitled inhuman imprisonment, abuses under occupation, ghettoizing the palestinians of haifa, rape, dividing the spoils, desecration of holy sites, entrenching the occupation, and the land robbery: 1950\u20132000. this chapter, like others, starts with provocative quotes. 'over 700,000 olive and orange trees have been destroyed by the israelis. this is an act of sheer vandalism from a state that claims to practice conservation of the environment.' the sections of this chapter include; the reinvention of palestine, virtual colonialism and the j.n.f., the j.n.f. parks in israel, the forest of birya, the ramat menahse park, and greening of jerusalem. papp\u00e9 states that 'the israeli land authority, the army, the government and the jewish national fund' have all been 'involved in establishing new jewish settlements on the lands of the destroyed palestinian villages.' he goes on to state, 'the true mission of the j.n.f., in other words, has been to conceal these visible remnants of palestine not only by the trees it has planted over them, but also by the narratives it has created to deny their existence.' as an example, papp\u00e9 refers to the forest of birya, which is the largest man made forest in israel. it conceals the land of six palestinian villages; dishon, alma,israel, qaddita, amqa, ayn al-zaytun, and biryya. also the ramat menashe park covers the ruins of lajjun, mansi, kafrayan, al-butaymat, hubeza, daliyat al-rawha, sabbarin, burayka, al-sindiyana, and umm al-zinat. the jerusalem forest is another example. here papp\u00e9 states that the creation of the united nations relief and work agency was not committed to the return of the refugees as resolution 194 was. there were one million palestinian refugees and u.n.r.w.a. was created to meet their daily needs as refugees. he states that international peace brokers consistently sidelined the palestinian cause and there 'was the categorical refusal of the israelis to acknowledge the nakba and their absolute unwillingness to be held accountable, legally, and morally, for the ethnic cleansing they committed in 1948.' for the following two decades there was a lull in international interest. then, 'the june war (1967) ended with total israeli control over all of ex-mandatory palestine.' as a response, for four decades, yassar arafat conducted a campaign to get the world to recognize that an ethnic cleansing had occurred in 1948. and according to papp\u00e9, this task for the palestinians continues to today. papp\u00e9 mentions that the knesset had even gone to the extent of passing a law that prohibited israeli negotiators from discussing the right of return. he also speculates that if israelis were to acknowledge the nakba that it would be akin to recognizing 'that they have become the mirror image of their own worst nightmare.' this chapter is about various measures israel has taken to protect itself. as an example, papp\u00e9 starts this chapter by describing a law the knesset passed on 31 july 2003. this law states that any palestinian who marries an israeli will not be granted israeli citizenship, permanent residency, or temporary residency. he also discusses the advent of the israeli west bank barrier. he states, 'none of this is new.' because theodore herzl wrote in 1895, 'we shall endeavor to expel the poor population across the border unnoticed, procuring employment for it in the transit countries, but denying it any employment in our own country.' in 2003 benyamin netanyahu said, 'if the arabs in israel form 40% of the population, this is the end of the jewish state. but 20% is also a problem. if the relationship with these 20% becomes problematic, the state is entitled to employ extreme measures.' here, papp\u00e9 states that the faculty club of tel aviv university is called the green house. it is built upon the remains of the palestinian village, shaykh muwannis. it is the epitome of the denial of ethnic cleansing according to papp\u00e9 because there is no mention of its true history. papp\u00e9 goes on to say, furthermore, that the university does not have a record of looking into the zionist history of ethnic cleansing whatsoever in any of its disciplines. he concludes by saying 'we end this book as we began: with the bewilderment that this crime was so utterly forgotten and erased from our minds and memories. but we now know the price: the ideology that enabled the depopulation of half of palestine's native people in 1948 is still alive and continues to drive inexorable, sometimes indiscernible, cleansing of those palestinians who live there today.'", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

the ones who assigned jacky's first previous mission as a spy. mairead and judy fight the british back but jacky is taken along with jaimy. jacky reunites with mr. peel and lord grenville. when jacky acts up, lord grenville reminds her of past relationships with spanish pirate, flaco jimenez, captain lord richard allen, and jean-paul de valdon just to inform jaimy of her cheating ways that he's already been subjected to back outside of new orleans. soon when they come to terms that jacky was about to embark on another mission, the two officials inform jacky of the assignment at hand. back in 1733, the ship 'santa magdalena' sunk due to a dangerous typhoon and on the ship was millions upon millions of gold in coins. britain wants to retrieve that gold to help the economy and jacky is promised a percentage of that gold and a possible pardon from the king himself, despite her crimes of piracy. luckily for jacky, jaimy is allowed to be with her on the mission but they will be on separate ships. both ships are jacky's: the 'dolphin' and 'nancy b. alsop.' on the 'dolphin', the ship will be commandeered by none other than captain hannibal hudson while jacky is to be captain of the 'nancy b.' jaimy is stationed on the dolphin along with lieutenant flashby. despite the fact that flashby will be in on this mission, jacky will have aboard her crew davy and tink from the dread brotherhood of the 'dolphin.' also on board her schooner is higgins, little joannie nichols and daniel prescott. jacky is also reunited with dr. sebastian who is \"the leader of scientific expedition.\" but as of right now, jacky don't know of anyone else who is to be helping on the expedition with the exception of her very own john thomas and smasher mcgee. what jacky is assigned to do is sail to the florida keys to where the 'santa magdalena' is located under the crystal blue waters of the caribbean. when allowed to leave, jacky and jaimy are aware of their positions on separate boats. another regulation is that there's to be no sexual intercourse between the two of them; the british have no use for a pregnant agent. they depart on their two separate ships and sail for boston. in spanish waters, jacky is required to take up a disguise as an american sponge diver called jacqueline bouvier. the spanish are conflicting with the british so jacky and her crew must maintain an american cover when in the caribbean. jacky prepares to revisit the lawson peabody school for young girls and wears her outrageous red wig and mantilla for the occasion. when there, she reunites with annie who is married davy and all her old lawson peabody friends and have dinner. she sees her friend and biographer, amy trevelyne, who has recently taken a liking for ezra pickering. jacky reunites with captain hudson and jaimy;

they get joannie to do it too, much to her dismay. when they get to the keys, jacky starts swimming immediately; her first dive is a dangerous one though. she has a run-in with what dr. sebastian knows as a moray eel. despite dr. sebastian's interest in the creature, jacky remains terrified after being put back on board. jacky decapitated the eel and gave the carcass to dr. sebastian. studying the coordinates of the 'santa magdalena's' resting place from carlos maria santana juarez's journals from 1733, jacky decides to explore the nearby island. she notices how there's a large amount of mangroves in the area and takes dr. sebastian, joannie, and daniel along for the trip. when there, jacky puts a red sash around a mangrove bush to indicate what island it be. jemimah told the kids to collect oysters and fresh water. the water's too salty as desired so they go back with no water. dr. sebastian notice fiddler crabs on the island and soon, the group are ambushed by alligators. it turns out the island is one big alligator pit and while they luckily escape. they have to save little joannie from one of the gators which breaks a couple of her ribs and gives her head a hard knock. once aboard, they tend to her immediately and think she's not going to make it. but joannie does in the end, and stays in jacky's bed for a week or so with daniel constantly at her side. jemimah soon exposes jacky to the chickens higgins brought aboard while in port. jacky makes note of a fiercely territorial banty rooster that she may have use for someday. soon, jacky is ready to dive down and find the 'santa magdalena'; the entire crew disagrees with her all except dr. sebastian that tells her that it's he that specifically 'instructs' her to do it. jacky dives into the water and within minutes, she finds the sunken ship. after such success, the moment is ruined by the sight of a spanish man-of-war. the boats is called the san cristobal and it is massive in size and in ammunition. the officer in charge demands who the fleet is and what's their purpose in spanish waters. unconvinced, the men scrounge the 'nancy b.' and find no evidence to prove the crew are fakes. in the mean time, jacky is hiding out in the waters and soon come up. she meets the cold-tempered yet dashing lieutenant and gets water on his shiny black boots. the spaniard forces jacky to shine his shoes for her mistake and the 'san cristobal' sets sail towards havana. so do jacky and the 'nancy b.'; taking in the views as heading into dock. she notices morro castle and the heavy fortification since the assault on the city by the british. in dock, the lieutenant from the 'san cristobal' introduces himself as juan carlos cisneros y siquieros. the man takes an extreme disliking towards jacky and jacky has mutual feelings. in dock, jemimah decides to explore the town and see if she likes it enough to make her own roots. jacky, davy, and tink explore the town; immersing in some cockfighting matches (where jacky trains her own banty rooster el gringo), performing at the cafe americano, among other activities. soon jemimah comes back to be a part of the crew but with richer, more tasteful clothes from the money she received working for faber shipping. daniel and joannie are happy to have their aunt jemimah back, obviously. one night at the cafe americano, jacky runs into old flame flaco jimenez and is introduced to flaco's new first mate, el feo. jacky is threatened by the presence of el feo instantly. it's a nice reunion but soon flaco tells jacky that he knows why she's down here in the caribbean, looking for treasure. turns out, that captain hudson let a \"ship-jumper\" on board the 'dolphin' and he gathered information for the spanish and is off in the world somewhere. this angers jacky; and by this time higgins and the crew comes to pick jacky up and carry her back to the 'nancy b.' spending days preparing for the cockfighting matches and immersing herself in jemimah's brother rabbit and brother fox tales, jaimy and the 'dolphin' crew soon meets back up with jacky. she gives them an update on her progress and spends the night with jaimy in her cabin. the next morning on board, jacky gets ready for her first descent using the diving bell; tink makes jacky some swim fins and she gets used to the diving bell's design. at first she uses the mechanism for getting some creatures for the doctor then she ventures down to the 'santa magdalena.' in the meantime, flaco jimenez and his ship is hanging around the vicinity of the wreckage, uneasing the crew deeply. jacky gets underwater towards the ship with a grappling hook and uses it to pry the golden crucifix from the mainmast but still gets no access to the lower spaces of the ship. taking a break from scavenging, jacky returns back to business and eventually finds the ship's vault, using the hook to unhinge the door off the vault, jacky finds the gold supply of the ship. in the process of getting the bell and the gold up into the ship, jacky contracts nitrogen narcosis, a condition similar to alcohol intoxication that leads from high amounts of nitrogen that gets in the bloodstream. jacky don't feel anything but when the pain from the rapture of the deep starts to kick in, she begins convulsing and shrieking until they get her back into the water to ease the condition. jaimy, even though he is nervous about being in the bell under water, takes her down where they make-out. dr. sebastian is angry with jacky for getting in the condition but he takes it out on professor tilden who didn't tell her of the rapture of the deep because \"she was just a girl\" and probably wouldn't \"understand the science.\" dr. sebastian assures tilden she is not a stupid girl and has jacky ushered to bed. the next day jacky starts putting the gold in baskets underwater when her own greed (a little mary faber talking in her head) tells her to put fan coral in the baskets and keep the gold for herself where she can use the gold to buy another ship like her precious 'emerald'. jacky does it, sneaking the gold into her undersea safehold for faber shipping worldwide. soon, jacky encounters flaco and his ship \"el diablo rojo\" and while they talk, flaco's first mate el feo plot a mutiny in secret. they hold the \"nancy b.\" and its crew at gunpoint but soon a fight among the two opposing ships commences. el feo and his new ship, the \"red devil\" sail off in retreat, leaving flaco with to side with jacky. back in town, jacky continues with the cockfighting matches and nights at the cafe americano. lieutenant cisneros corners jacky in the club and nearly provokes a fight but ric, the owner of the cafe, points out the bar's etiquette rules and orders the lieutenant to leave. cisneros does but vows that it's not over between the two of them. as for jaimy and the rest of the 'dolphin', they end up in kingston perfectly fine. they are invited to the officers' club where it is there, jaimy runs into captain richard allen. jaimy instantly remembers allen from the time he caught allen and jacky skinnydipping in the mississippi river. allen also remembers jaimy and they have an awkward conversation. things get even more awkward when allen runs into flashby. after another cockfighting match, jacky tells joannie to go collect the winnings of the match. but she does not return and jacky soon figures out she's missing. the crew goes all over havana looking for the girl to little success. they hear that a white man took joannie. while on the open sea, jacky runs into el feo and his crew. they are taken aboard and it's found out that el feo himself kidnapped joannie. jacky also find out that flashby's been working undercover for el feo the entire mission, something of a \"double agent.\" el feo demands to be shown where the gold is at and jacky's doesn't fess until joannie and daniel are threatened with their lives. jacky lies to el feo, saying it's all on the nearby island (the island full of mangroves and alligator pits.) el feo has flashby and his crew sail to the island and look for it while the rest stay aboard the 'red devil.' el feo then takes jacky to his living quarters where it's there, that he attempts to rape jacky. daniel and joannie intervene; releasing el gringo on el feo- stunning him. then jemimah takes her huge frying pan that she bought in town and knocks him out cold. jacky's crew is then able to upheave the 'red devil' and throw el feo's body into the water to be with the remnants of the 'santa magdalena.' finally the 'san cristobal' comes into view, attacking both ships. but the 'dolphin' comes to aid jacky and the crew just in the nick of time. jacky reunites with both jaimy and captain allen and fights off the spanish warship. cisneros then comes aboard for jacky personally, vowing to kill her. fearlessly, just as he is about to, jacky whips out her pistol and shoots him. with the battle soon over, flaco regains his old ship and gives back the ship its original name. he kisses jacky and thanks her for the help, leaving the battlefield. jaimy then soon embarks to be an officer in command on the newly-named 'saint christopher.' flaco soon comes back for his share of the gold and the gold is split evenly between the crew. the spanish sailor leaves for the southern horizon and jacky makes her way back to boston where her crew splits up. jemimah has federal agents search the nation for her kids that were also victims of slavery; jim tanner reunites with clementine; davy reunites with annie; smasher and john go off on their own journey; el gringo retires to dovecote; and joannie goes back to the lawson peabody, much to her dismay. jacky returns to stay with amy trevelyne and ezra pickering and keeps her current crew: higgins, davy, tink, daniel, and herself. jacky tells ezra that she plans on buying a ship with the gold that she hid away.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

in particular a girl called molly, a year or two his senior. eventually fitz agrees to become a \"king's man\" to king shrewd and is bound by oath to serve the king. he is taken into king shrewd's service and moves into the castle proper. here he is schooled and is taught basic combat skills by hod, the keep weaponmaster. one night he is also introduced to a recluse named chade, who is a skilled assassin. fitz agrees to learn chade's skills as he is desperately lonely and seemingly has no other prospects. so during his childhood he is taught the ways of an assassin. he shows great talent in his duties and is able to complete the minor tasks given to him by the king. meanwhile, news comes from withywoods of chivalry's death - it is said that he was thrown from a horse, but it is strongly suspected that queen desire, king shrewd's second wife and regal's mother, has had him assassinated. as fitz is growing up at buckkeep, the coastal regions of the six duchies are being attacked by outislanders known as the red-ship raiders. the raiders rampage through villages and towns, killing and taking hostages while stealing little, making their attacks seem to lack a motive. the hostages are returned, reduced to an animal like state with little memory of their former lives. fitz, when he encounters these returned hostages, finds he cannot sense them with his wit at all. this stripping away of people's humanity is named after forge, the first village to be plundered in such a way. later on these forged ones become robbers and thieves that start to plunder the countryside, putting another burden on the six duchies. fitz is eventually made part of a class of students to be taught the skill, a magic which allows its users to share thoughts and strength. the teacher, galen, despises fitz while curiously revering his father (it is revealed later in the book that chivalry imprinted a false loyalty on him, using the skill, in a fit of rage). during the classes, galen treats fitz without respect, referring to him as \"bastard\". eventually he tries to kill fitz, then, with more success, tries to sabotage his skill training. during the last test of galen's skill classes, galen sends fitz to forge, ostensibly to see if he can use the skill to get back. the area is infested with forged ones, and fitz is attacked, although he manages to return safely. while he is away, a stable hand in league with galen attempts to assassinate burrich. during this event, smithy, the dog lady patience gave fitz, and with whom fitz is wit-bonded, is killed. towards the end of the book fitz is asked to go to the neighbouring mountain kingdom with the objective of assassinating its prince, rurisk. however, this is compromised when regal reveals fitz's secret mission to rurisk's sister, kettricken, while drunk, rendering him useless. he finds himself in the middle of a plan to steal the throne for prince regal with the help of galen, who tries to assassinate verity, using the skill. prince rurisk is poisoned and killed, leaving kettricken, who is betrothed to verity, the sole heir of the mountain kingdom. fitz is poisoned and later submerged under water in a deep pool, a lazy attempt by regal to finish fitz off. when fitz feels he only has moments to live, he manages to contact verity using the skill to help him destroy galen. he is rescued by his dog nosy, who was not killed by burrich, but sent to the mountain kingdom as a gift to prince rurisk. the rescue from the pool by nosy left deep teeth marks in his hand that he comes to cherish as a sign of nosy's love and loyalty. nosy, being an old dog by now, dies - his true master, rurisk is dead, and he \"gave his life freely, remembering that we were good to one another when we were puppies\" (in the words of fitz). fitz is healed by jonqui, king eyod's sister, afterward, and the last pages of the book tell how much fitz laments the death of nosy during that event and the pain of an older narrator at writing this.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

planet is similar to mid-20th century earth. recently, the planet had a nuclear and conventional war and the predicament of the population is dire. when kammerer lands, the natives mistake his spaceship for a weapon and destroy it. at first, kammerer does not take his situation seriously. he imagines himself a robinson crusoe stranded on an island inhabited by primitive but friendly natives. he is looking forward to establishing contact and befriending the population of the planet. however, the reality turns out to be far from glamorous. kammerer finds himself in the capital of a totalitarian state, perpetually at war with its neighbors. the population is governed by the oligarchy of unknown fathers through brutal police and military repression. the city is grim and polluted. ordinary populace leads the life of privation and misery. what goes on around kammerer does not make sense to him, since his own society is free from war, crime and material shortages. eventually, it is revealed that to maintain the loyalty of the population, the fathers employ mind control broadcasts. the broadcast towers pepper the landscape of the country. the mind-altering capabilities of the towers are kept secret, they are disguised as ballistic missile defense installations. constant broadcasts suppress the ability to evaluate information critically, hence making the omnipresent regime propaganda much more effective. in addition, twice a day, intense broadcasts relieve mental stress caused by the disconnect between the propaganda and the observed reality by inducing an outburst of blinding enthusiasm. the authors give a masterful description of this process at work, describing the thoughts of one of the characters as he switches from the state of peeved boredom and disdain for his superiors to the rapturous adoration of people around him and life in general. a minority of the population are not susceptible to the broadcasts. in these people, the intense daily broadcasts induce horrible headache and seizures. the unknown fathers \u2014 the ruling oligarchs are in this minority. they pay for the power to control the people by intense personal suffering during the daily broadcasts. the people outside the power elite that are not susceptible to the broadcasts are branded degenerates or degens by the state. they are actively persecuted. when captured they are either executed or sent to prison. the renegade degens organized an underground resistance movement and try to fight back by destroying the broadcast towers. the resistance does not have any political or military program and the fighters are united mostly by their suffering and their hatred of the towers. however, the rank-and-file of the underground is unaware of the main purpose of the towers. apparently, the underground leadership wants to capture the broadcast network and use it to seize the power in the state for themselves. kammerer, still not quite aware of the situation, gets enlisted in the military. he is required to execute captured \"degens\", one of them a woman. when he refuses, he is shot. kammerer survives, joins the underground and participates in a futile attack on a broadcast tower. captured, tried and sent to a concentration camp in the south, the same one where he made his landing, he's finally revealed the truth about the broadcast system by a fellow prisoner member of underground. astonished and appalled by the revelation, kammerer makes it his mission to rid the planet of the mind control broadcast system. several of his schemes fail because the cure may be worse than the disease. he tries to organize an invasion by barbarian tribes from the inhospitable desert in the south. he then tries to contact the state's neighbor \u2014 the island empire. he abandons this plan after finding documents on a destroyed empire submarine that describe mass killings and other atrocities that the empire military perpetrates. he now focuses on trying to find and destroy the control center where the mind control broadcasts originate. kammerer gets captured and is consigned to a penal battalion that is supposed to lead the invasion of the north. in this abortive action, most of his friends perish while kammerer himself barely escapes annihilation in retaliatory nuclear blasts. it turns out that kammerer is not affected by the broadcasts in any way. a father known as smart realizes that and plots to use kammerer to stage a coup and take over the power in the state. his plan is for kammerer to capture the control center and use the mind control broadcasts to incapacitate the rivals and control the population. the center is protected by intense local broadcasts that make it impossible for anyone but kammerer to penetrate it. initially, kammerer plays along. however, after gaining access to the center, instead of using it to gain power, kammerer destroys it. in the end of the novel it is revealed that one of the fathers \u2014 strannik (literally \"wanderer\") - is a human progressor rudolf sikorski. strannik was carefully preparing the operation to gradually improve the lot of the people of saraksh. his plan was ruined by kammerer's actions. strannik catches kammerer and lambastes him for his interference. strannik describes the unanticipated consequences of kammerer's rash actions: up to 20% of the people may die due to the withdrawal of the mind control transmissions on which they have become dependent; saraksh faces famine, anarchy and invasion from the north. strannik tells kammerer to leave the planet. however, kammerer refuses and stays to help strannik stabilize the situation. despite the upheavals that saraksh has to go through, kammerer is still glad he destroyed the control center because now the people are in charge of their own destiny.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

(he can set up the reflections conveniently because he sleeps in a separate room from his wife; their relations had long been friendly but mutually uncomprehending.) fascinated by the sigil and mysterious clues he receives, by his dreams, and by the ironic philosophical speculations they lead him to, he loses interest in ordinary life apart from his next book. just before that book is published, he enters his wife's dressing room in her absence and finds the other half of the sigil. he concludes that she was ettare all along, and he remembers his former love for her. however, she ignores his tentative affection, and her only comment when he shows her the sigil is that their neighbor harrowby might know something about it. she throws both pieces away. without the inspiration of his dreams, kennaston largely stops writing. his wife dies. as harrowby is interested in the occult, kennaston follows his wife's hint by showing him the sigil (found in her dressing room) and telling him about the dreams. harrowby recognizes it as the mock-antique lid of his company's brand of cold cream. he does not disillusion kennaston, but \"gently\" raises the possibility that the sigil might not be miraculous. kennaston scornfully replies that such a possibility would not change what the sigil taught him: everything in life is miraculous. cabell himself drew the book's image of the sigil, which looks like writing in a strange alphabet. when turned upside-down and looked at in a mirror, it reads, \"james branch cabell made this book so that he who wills may read the story of man's eternally unsatisfied hunger in search of beauty. ettare stays inaccessible always and her loveliness is his to look on only in his dreams\".", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

{"id": 6532, "text": " the book opens during midmorning in the mansion of and with albanus the wizard, vegentius the commander of the golden leopards (the bodyguard regiment of nemedia's kings), demetrio amarianus a landowner, constanto melius a noble, and sephana galerianus a rejected mistress of king garian. they are gathered to plot the usurping of the dragon throne of the kingdom of nemedia. during the meeting, albanus demonstrates some magic to placate and wow his guests by summoning a fire elemental to destroy one of his servants. the conspirators are impressed by this and desire to have some magical devices of their own \"as a token that [they] are all equals.\" melius chooses a sword imbued with the skills of six master swordsmen. the sword grants the wielder sword mastery. moving the focus of the novel to conan, it describes how the city of belverus in nemedia is unsafe, the tariffs exorbitantly high, starvation rampant, sedition brewing, and that king garian seems ineffective as a ruler. in reality, albanus is busy funding and controlling all the unrest in nemedia as a means of focusing hatred on king garian. conan is attacked in belverus by melius, who it later turns out was driven insane and \"possessed\" in a fashion by the tortured spirits in the magical sword he was given by albanus. albanus did not know that the blade could cause such madness. conan is rescued by the town guard who find, to their horror, that they have just slain a noble. conan picks up the blade and wraps it with the hopes of selling it for a few pieces of silver. shortly thereafter, conan meets up with hordo, a friend of his from several previous and mostly unsuccessful quests who is now a smuggler. hordo tries to get conan a job as a smuggler as well, but is harangued by his boss for not being cautious enough (exposing a smuggler fetches a high bounty). hordo decides to quit his job and join conan in his mercenary venture. hordo is often used as a foil to conan, contrasting the intelligence of conan to hordo's less sophisticated thought process and abilities of perception. the pair go to a tavern where conan's fortune is divinated by an old man. the same fortune appears on the first page of the first mass market printing. the first part of the prophecy comes true as conan thwarts an attempt by a lady patron of the tavern from pick pocketing him. leaving the tavern, conan and hordo noticed they are being followed by what turns out to ariane, a poet and patron the inn the sign of thestis. the three are then attacked by footpads. all the footpads are slain. hordo and conan then spend the night at the sign of thestis, telling stories of their adventures. conan learns that the thestians (including ariane and sephano, a sculptor) are plotting an uprising against the king along with taras and the mercenaries which he is hiring to aid in the uprising. conan and hordo then are attacked by more armed murderers. conan figures someone is out to kill him, though he knows not who. it turns out later to be albanus trying to recover the magic sword and cover up all traces of it. upon returning to the thestis, conan sells the magic sword of melius to demetrio, an agent of albanus, for fifty gold marks. conan uses the money from the sword to found his own free-company of mercenaries and teaches them horse archer techniques unknown to the nemedian forces. the next time conan returns to the thestis, conan receives a message that he should meet hordo at the sign of the full moon. the thestians are worried that they may be betrayed, but conan allays these fears by vowing to never betray them. at the sign of the full moon, conan is ambushed and attacked by assassins. he is also pursued by the belverus town guard who have also been paid off by albanus. the message was fake. the next day, ariane sets up a meeting for conan with taras to see if conan can be hired for the uprising. it turns out taras is not hiring mercenaries and intends to kill conan as per albanus's request. the attempt is thwarted and the ambushers are all killed by conan. ariane, having followed conan, sees the butchery and believes that conan has betrayed them. the horse archer skills get conan's company a job in the nemedian military and conan a room within the palace, much to the dismay of vegentius the conspirator. conan winds up practicing his sword skills with king garian and besting garian each time. meanwhile, albanus has captured stephano the sculptor and forced him to create a likeness of king garian. conan is asked by the king to deliver a letter to albanus. while at the palace, conan sees stephano and later tells ariane where stephano has gone. ariane goes to find stephano at albanus's mansion but is captured and hypnotized by albanus. vegentius ambushes conan in the halls of the palace and frames him as a traitor. king garian decides that the \"ancient punishment\" would be the best in the case of a turncoat. meanwhile, albanus uses magic on the clay sculpture of garian and animates it so as to be a simalcrum of garian. albanus kills stephano. the plan is: the simalcrum takes over the place of the real garian, albanus sends the signal for the unknowing thestians to rise up and rebel, and the simalcrum hands over power to albanus to appease the rebels. conan learns that king garian has been replaced when albanus and the simalcrum come to gloat over conan in the dungeons of the palace. conan learns this because the simalcrum does not have the bruises that conan gave the real garian while they were sparring. as conan is imprisoned, the people rise up at the behest of the hypnotized ariane. conan is sent to the arena of belverus to be devoured by the wolves as the ancient punishment dictates. conan thwarts the wolves by rushing into them as they are released and smashing through them and out the still-open gate through which the wolves were released. conan fights his way through and is rescued by hordo, karela (the red hawk, friend of hordo who knows the secret passages of the palace), and the rest of conan's free-company. conan and friends ride through the uprising streets of belverus, creep over the albanus's walls, and into albanus's mansion; they promptly rescue king garian from the dungeons of albanus. reasoning that most of the golden leopards are still loyal to king garian, the whole group rides up to the gates of the palace and garian instructs the guards that albanus and vegentius are traitors and to spread the message that all who do not shout \"death to albanus and vegentius!\" are traitors and are to be killed. conan's company and garian split at this point. conan and his company fight their way through the palace. eventually, conan leaves his company and kills vegentius in one of the palace courtyards. conan finally confronts albanus in one of the giant auditoriums of the palace. conan impales albnus, but as he dies he is chanting and summoning a great demon. luckily, the demon fades. the chant was either incomplete or the demon just left. the story ends with conan, hordo, and karela split. conan leaves for ophir, listening to the prophecy of the old man. \"beware the gratitude of kings.\"", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

he also befriends white, the smooth-mannered butler. ogden ford arrives a few days later, and a rather shocked abney requests that burns discourage his rudeness and smoking. burns quickly learns that any attempt to kidnap the tempestuous boy will require great skill. time passes and ford introduces numerous vices to the school. in the local inn one day, burns sees a suspicious-looking american; later, he sees white the butler chasing someone away from the school with a pistol. white explains that he is a detective from the pinkerton agency, hired by mr ford to watch over his son. the following day, another american visits the school, a pleasant man claiming to be a friend of mr ford, who soon leaves again having toured the place. the next evening, burns is strolling outside when he hears ogden scream, and a man runs into him, knocking him down. an excited crowd gathers to discuss the incident, a man found breaking into ogden's room, when mrs sheridan appears, for an appointment with abeny; burns quickly sees that she is in fact his former fianc\u00e9e, audrey. things are awkward between them at first, but they soon make up. burns meets the american from the village, who turns out to be buck macginnis, former kidnapper of ogden, and who thinks burns is none other than his rival, \"smooth\" sam fisher. burns questions white about these men, and learns that while buck a common hoodlum, fisher is an educated and dangerously smooth man. spending more time with audrey, he realises his love for her is still strong. one day macginnis and his gang raid the school, holding up the masters at gunpoint. macginnis takes burns to search for ogden, but burns flees out of the study window. as he is climbing out macginnis shoots him, but he makes it to the cover of some bushes. burns tackles macginnis, breaking his leg, and the gang flees without the missing ogden. burns frees the rest of the school, and the police are called. ogden still cannot be found, and a friend is also found to be missing. burns volunteers to go to london to search for the runaways, and audrey implores him to search well, saying she will lose her job with mr ford if ogden is not found. we learn that burns has bribed ogden to go to london, and arranged to have his valet send the boy to his mother nesta ford. abney the headmaster, sick in bed with a cold, learns that the butler is a detective and sends him on the trip to london with burns. on the way white reveals that he saw burns give ogden his directions, and also that he is in fact none other than smooth sam fisher, proposing to come in with burns on the presumed kidnapping job. burns flees to his flat, but learns that ogden has not arrived there. fisher arrives having followed burns, but on learning ogden is off enjoying london he leaves to seek him. after a day's search, burns finds the boy at the house of his friend's mother, and brings him back to the school. fisher also returns, threatening to expose burns' actions if his identity is revealed. ogden is moved to a safe room, and guarded; burns' relationship with audrey chills after he is reminded he is engaged, and he foils another attempt by fisher to take the boy. the school term ends, but mr ford cannot collet ogden for a few days, so abney asks burns to join audrey and the butler in guarding him, but fisher reveals burns' plot to return ogden to his mother. burns leaves in shame, but returns and contacts audrey to tell her about fisher. she doesn't trust him, remaining aloof, and he sees macginnis is also back in the neighbourhood. he drives fisher out of the house, and takes guard himself, still without audrey's faith. fisher comes back having joined up with macginnis, and offers burns a last chance, which he rejects. with the phone wires cut, burns tries to sneak ogden across country, but they are trapped in the loft of the school stables. ogden, bored of the chase, surrenders himself, and audrey breaks down in tears, comforted by burns. some days later, burns and audrey speak of their love, but she insists he stand by his promise to cynthia. they part, and cynthia's mother appears with nesta ford. mr ford also arrives, as does sam fisher, who persuades ford to reunite with his wife and to take fisher on as ogden's security guard, in lieu of a ransome. ford agrees and they leave. mrs drassilis reveals that cynthia has fallen for lord mountry, and burns gives them his blessing, releasing her from the engagement. he heads off after audrey.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

(or w3b), and has won rs. one billion (about $22 million). however, show host prem kumar and the producers, who do not have the money to pay him, have had the police arrest him for cheating; they had cast ram because they figured an uneducated street child would not be able to answer more than a few questions at most, and they find the police more than willing to believe them. ram explains to his sympathetic lawyer, smita shah, (who has rescued him from being tortured), just how he managed to answer twelve random questions: they related to real events that occurred in his life, with each question prompting its own flashback. as he says, \"well, wasn't i lucky they only asked those questions to which i knew the answers?\". ram goes on to tell her how by drawing from the experiences of his own short, yet turbulent and sometimes cruel life, he, a young, poor waiter, answered the twelve questions that led him to the jackpot. through this device, the novel moves between mumbai, delhi and agra (non-chronologically) as it highlights ram's bizarre experiences, from his original upbringing by an english-speaking priest to his various jobs, which include working as house help for an aging bollywood actress, in a foundry, an australian diplomat who turns out to be in a spy ring, as a tourist guide in agra and a waiter in a bar at mumbai. his best friend is another young orphan named salim, who plays a part in some of these adventures and dreams of becoming an actor, as it was foretold by a palmist at a fair. ram was told by the same palmist that he would not live a very long life, but he doesn't believe in foretelling the future and dismisses it. salim later becomes an actor after saving a bollywood producer from assassination from a professional hitman. however, the key events of ram's life come when he works as a tour guide at the taj mahal, which is when he meets a young prostitute named nita. he falls in love with her and asks her pimp to let her marry him, but the pimp refuses. meanwhile, ram's friend shankar is dying of rabies. he needs 400,000 rupees to buy a vaccination, and nita's pimp demands the same amount. shankar dies, and ram steals the money from shankar's uncaring mother. after learning that the pimp (who is also nita's brother) will continue to demand even more money, he instead gives it to an english teacher whose son needs the rabies vaccine. the teacher later helps answer ram's question about william shakespeare when ram uses his friendly tip lifeboat. ram tells his lawyer that he went on the show partly in a quest to win enough money to buy nita's freedom from her pimp, and partly in a bid to get even with the show's host, prem kumar, who abused and exploited nita, resulting in her being placed under intensive care in hospital. prem also exploited the late neelima kumari, a former bollywood actress and ram's former employer. ram had planned to kill him when he went for a bathroom break (show rules dictate that the contestant must be followed everywhere by the host so they cannot cheat). however, ram decides against it and, in gratitude, kumar tells him the answer of the last question, which was the only answer he might have not have answered correctly.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}
