This genetic alteration which Bean passed to his children grants them all extremely high intelligence but causes their bodies to grow uncontrollably which is likely to kill them by the age of 20 Subjectively they have been flying near lightspeed for five years but relativistic effects mean that 421 years have passed on Earth  the year is now 2631 When the family left scientists were actively trying to find a cure for their giantism which would not diminish their intelligence Several generations have passed and they have been forgotten their mother and normal siblings having died centuries ago The children have only been alive for six subjective years Beans life has been extended by the low gravity on board the Herodotus which allows his heart to keep beating despite his increasingly gigantic size At 45 metres tall Bean must remain in a lying position in the cargo bay so as not to overexert himself He controls and watches everything on the ship through his holotop terminal often prompting the children to have secret meetings they believe the Giant cannot hear Bean and Ender continue to study their genetic condition in the hope of finding a cure In one of these meetings the militarilyminded Cincinnatus nicknamed Sergeant tries to enlist the aid of his siblings in killing their father saying he is a drain on resources The sensitive Carlotta whose specialty is engineering is unwilling to take a stance but Ender an expert biologist punches Sergeant and breaks his nose for proposing such an idea thus ending his brothers domination over the family Ender and Carlotta tell Bean about Sergeants plans and Bean puts all three children in their place reminding them they are each as intelligent as the other Sergeant has been imagining threats to their security where there are none because he believes the Giant means to pass his soldier role onto him So he studies the Formic war vids and learning his fathers strategy while training himself with weaponry Ender takes on the bulk of the genetic studies by monitoring the advances made by the scientists on Earth Carlotta who feels slightly left behind with the genetic studies serves the family by taking care of every aspect of the spacecraft since Bean himself is stuck in the cargo hold After despairing at the condition of their lives and in the light of the discovery that their condition cannot be cured Carlotta

turn possibly killing Bean with the increased gravity However they cannot anticipate who or what is in the spacecraft it may attack them or they may be detrimental to the survival and progression of the human race This hypothesis is solidified when Sergeant deduces that the ship is a Formic Ark a colony ship that has been in flight for centuries Bean sends Sergeant alone to investigate the ship and he escapes an attack by small Formiclike animals they call rabs After this initial encounter Bean reveals his full plan to his children They must find out who is piloting this ship and attempting to terraform the planet it orbits It was Beans intention all along to have his children live on this planet and found their new species in safety as soon as he picked it up on radar as lying within the Goldilocks zone Armed with Sergeants weapons and a sedative fog spray Ender devised Sergeant commands defenses as Carlotta leads their group to the helm with Bean in contact the whole time The

Ender surrenders himself by drifting close to them in zero gravity The male drones come close and communicate with Ender via mental images The group learns that the Ark was sent long before Ender

wanted for the understanding as for the hand And as the instruments of the hand either give motion or guide it so the instruments of the mind supply either suggestions for the understanding or cautions\nIII\nHuman knowledge and human power meet in one for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced Nature to be commanded must be obeyed and that which in contemplation is as

of the mind and hand seem very numerous in books and manufactures But all this variety lies in an exquisite subtlety and derivations from a few things already known not in the number of axioms\nVIII\nMoreover the works already known are due to chance and experiment rather than to sciences for the sciences we now possess are merely systems for the nice ordering and setting forth of things already invented not methods of invention or directions for new works\nIX\nThe cause and root of nearly all evils in the sciences is this  that while we falsely admire and extol the powers of the human mind we neglect to seek for its true helps\nX\nThe subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of the senses and understanding so that all those specious meditations speculations and glosses in which men indulge are quite from the purpose only there is no one by to observe it\nXI\nAs the sciences which we now have do not help us in finding out new works so neither does the logic which we now have help us in finding out new sciences\nXII\nThe logic now in use serves rather to fix and give stability to the errors which have their foundation in commonly received notions than to help the search after truth So it does more harm than good\nXIII\nThe syllogism is not applied to the first principles of sciences and is applied in vain to intermediate axioms being no match for the subtlety of nature It commands assent therefore to the proposition but does not take hold of the thing\nXIV\nThe syllogism consists of propositions propositions consist of words words are symbols of notions Therefore if the notions themselves which is the root of the matter are confused and overhastily abstracted from the facts there can be no firmness in the superstructure Our only hope therefore lies in a true induction\nXV\nThere is no soundness in our notions whether logical or physical Substance Quality Action Passion Essence itself are not sound notions much less are Heavy Light Dense Rare Moist Dry Generation Corruption Attraction Repulsion Element Matter Form and the like but all are fantastical and ill defined\nXVI\nOur notions of less general species as Man Dog Dove and of the immediate perceptions of the sense as Hot Cold Black White do not materially mislead us yet even these are sometimes confused by the flux and alteration of matter and the mixing of one thing with another All the others which men have hitherto adopted are but wanderings not being abstracted and formed from things by proper methods\nXVII\nNor is there less of wilfulness and wandering in the construction of axioms than in the formations of notions not excepting even those very principles which are obtained by common induction but much more in the axioms and lower propositions educed by the syllogism\nXVIII\nThe discoveries which have hitherto been made in the sciences are such as lie close to vulgar notions scarcely beneath the surface In order to penetrate into the inner and further recesses of nature it is necessary that both notions and axioms be derived from things by a more sure and guarded way and that a method of intellectual operation be introduced altogether better and more certain\nXIX\nThere are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms and from these principles the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms And this way is now in fashion The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all This is the true way but as yet untried\nXX\nThe understanding left to itself takes the same course namely the former which it takes in accordance with logical order For the mind longs to spring up to positions of higher generality that it may find rest there and so after a little while wearies of experiment But this evil is increased by logic because of the order and solemnity of its disputations\nXXI\nThe understanding left to itself in a sober patient and grave mind especially if it be not hindered by received doctrines tries a little that other way which is the right one but with little progress since the understanding unless directed and assisted is a thing unequal and quite unfit to contend with the obscurity of things\nXXII\nBoth ways set out from the senses and particulars and rest in the highest generalities but the difference between them is infinite For the one just glances at experiment and particulars in passing the other dwells duly and orderly among them The one again begins at once by establishing certain abstract and useless generalities the other rises by gradual steps to that which is prior and better known in the order of nature\nXXIII\nThere is a great difference between the Idols of the human mind and the Ideas of the divine That is to say between certain empty dogmas and the true signatures and marks set upon the works of creation as they are found in nature\nXXIV\nIt cannot be that axioms established by argumentation should avail for the discovery of new works since the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument But axioms duly and orderly formed from particulars easily discover the way to new particulars and thus render sciences active\nXXV\nThe axioms now in use having been suggested by a scanty and manipular experience and a few particulars of most general occurrence are made for the most part just large enough to fit and take these in and therefore it is no wonder if they do not lead to new particulars And if some opposite instance not observed or not known before chance to come in the way the axiom is rescued and preserved by some frivolous distinction whereas the truer course would be to correct the axiom itself\nXXVI\nThe conclusions of human reason as ordinarily applied in matter of nature I call for the sake of distinction Anticipations of Nature as a thing rash or premature That reason which is elicited from facts by a just and methodical process I call Interpretation of Nature\nXXVII\nAnticipations are a ground sufficiently firm for consent for even if men went mad all after the same fashion they might agree one with another well enough\nXXVIII\nFor the winning of assent indeed anticipations are far more powerful than interpretations because being collected from a few instances and those for the most part of familiar occurrence they straightway touch the understanding and fill the imagination whereas interpretations on the other hand being gathered here and there from very various and widely dispersed facts cannot suddenly strike the understanding and therefore they must needs in respect of the opinions of the time seem harsh and out of tune much as the mysteries of faith do\nXXIX\nIn sciences founded on opinions and dogmas the use of anticipations and logic is good for in them the object is to command assent to the proposition not to master the thing\nXXX\nThough all the wits of all the ages should meet together and combine and transmit their labours yet will no great progress ever be made in science by means of anticipations because radical errors in the first concoction of the mind are not to be cured by the excellence of functions and remedies subsequent\nXXXI\nIt is idle to expect any great advancement in science from the superinducing and engrafting of new things upon old We must begin anew from the very foundations unless we would revolve for ever in a circle with mean and contemptible progress\nXXXII\nThe honour of the ancient authors and indeed of all remains untouched since the comparison I challenge is not of wits or faculties but of ways and methods and the part I take upon myself is not that of a judge but of a guide\nXXXIII\nThis must be plainly avowed no judgment can be rightly formed either of my method or of the discoveries to which it leads by means of anticipations that is to say of the reasoning which is now in use since I cannot be called on to abide by the sentence of a tribunal which is itself on its trial\nXXXIV\nEven to deliver and explain what I bring forward is no easy matter for things in themselves new will yet be apprehended with reference to what is old\nXXXV\nIt was said by Borgia of the expedition of the French into Italy that they came with chalk in their hands to mark out their lodgings not with arms to force their way in I in like manner would have my doctrine enter quietly into the minds that are fit and capable of receiving it for confutations cannot be employed when the difference is upon first principles and very notions and even upon forms of demonstration\nXXXVI\nOne method of delivery alone remains to us which is simply this we must lead men to the particulars themselves and their series and order while men on their side must force themselves for awhile to lay their notions by and begin to familiarise themselves with facts\nXXXVII\nThe doctrine of those who have denied that certainty could be attained at all has some agreement with my way of proceeding at the first setting out but they end in being infinitely separated and opposed For the holders of that doctrine assert simply that nothing can be known I also assert that not much can be known in nature by the way which is now in use But then they go on to destroy the authority of the senses and understanding whereas I proceed to devise and supply helps for the same\nXXXVIII\nThe idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding and have taken deep root therein not only so beset mens minds that truth can hardly find entrance but even after entrance obtained they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults\nXXXIX\nThere are four classes of Idols which beset mens minds To these for distinctions sake I have assigned names  calling the first class Idols of the Tribe the second Idols of the Cave the third Idols of the Marketplace the fourth Idols of the Theatre\nXL\nThe formation of ideas and axioms by true induction is no doubt the proper remedy to be applied for the keeping off and clearing away of idols To point them out however is of great use for the doctrine of Idols is to the Interpretation of Nature what the doctrine of the refutation of Sophisms is to common Logic\nXLI\nThe Idols of the Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself and in the tribe or race of men For it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things On the contrary all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe And the human understanding is like a false mirror which receiving rays irregularly distorts and discolours the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it\nXLII\nThe Idols of the Cave are the idols of the individual man For every one besides the errors common to human nature in general has a cave or den of his own which refracts and discolours the light of nature owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature or to his education and conversation with others or to the reading of books and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires or to the differences of impressions accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled or the like So that the spirit of man according as it is meted out to different individuals is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation and governed as it were by chance Whence it was well observed by Heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds and not in the greater or common world\nXLIII\nThere are also Idols formed by the intercourse and association of men with each other which I call Idols of the Marketplace on account of the commerce and consort of men there For it is by discourse that men associate and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar And therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding Nor do the definitions or explanations wherewith in some things learned men are wont to guard and defend themselves by any means set the matter right But words plainly force and overrule the understanding and throw all into confusion and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies\nXLIV\nLastly there are Idols which have immigrated into mens minds from the various dogmas of philosophies and also from wrong laws of demonstration These I call Idols of the Theatre because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stageplays representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion Nor is it only of the systems now in vogue or only of the ancient sects and philosophies that I speak for many more plays of the same kind may yet be composed and in like artificial manner set forth seeing that errors the most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike Neither again do I mean this only of entire systems but also of many principles and axioms in science which by tradition credulity and negligence have come to be received\nBut of these several kinds of Idols I must speak more largely and exactly that the understanding may be duly cautioned\nXLV\nThe human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds And though there be many things in nature which are singular and unmatched yet it devises for them parallels and conjugates and relatives which do not exist Hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles spirals and dragons being except in name utterly rejected Hence too the element of Fire with its orb is brought in to make up the square with the other three which the sense perceives Hence also the ratio of density of the socalled elements is arbitrarily fixed at ten to one And so on of other dreams And these fancies affect not dogmas only but simple notions also\nXLVI\nThe human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself draws all things else to support and agree with it And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side yet these it either neglects and despises or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate And therefore it was a good answer that was made by one who when they showed him hanging in a temple a picture of those who had paid their vows as having escaped shipwreck and would have him say whether he did not now acknowledge the power of the gods  Aye asked he again but where are they painted that were drowned after their vows And such is the way of all superstition whether in astrology dreams omens divine judgments or the like wherein men having a delight in such vanities mark the events where they are fulfilled but where they fail though this happen much oftener neglect and pass them by But with far more subtlety does this mischief insinuate itself into philosophy and the sciences in which the first conclusion colours and brings into conformity with itself all that come after though far sounder and better Besides independently of that delight and vanity which I have described it is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human intellect to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives whereas it ought properly to hold itself indifferently disposed towards both alike Indeed in the establishment of any true axiom the negative instance is the more forcible of the two\nXLVII\nThe human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly and so fill the imagination and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow though it cannot see how similar to those few things by which it is surrounded But for that going to and fro to remote and heterogeneous instances by which axioms are tried as in the fire the intellect is altogether slow and unfit unless it be forced thereto by severe laws and overruling authority\nXLVIII\nThe human understanding is unquiet it cannot stop or rest and still presses onward but in vain Therefore it is that we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond Neither again can it be conceived how eternity has flowed down to the present day for that distinction which is commonly received of infinity in time past and in time to come can by no means hold for it would thence follow that one infinity is greater than another and that infinity is wasting away and tending to become finite The like subtlety arises touching the infinite divisibility of lines from the same inability of thought to stop But this inability interferes more mischievously in the discovery of causes for although the most general principles in nature ought to be held merely positive as they are discovered and cannot with truth be referred to a cause nevertheless the human understanding being unable to rest still seeks something prior in the order of nature And then it is that in struggling towards that which is further off it falls back upon that which is more nigh at hand namely on final causes which have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy But he is no less an unskilled and shallow philosopher who seeks causes of that which is most general than he who in things subordinate and subaltern omits to do so\nXLIX\nThe human understanding is no dry light but receives an infusion from the will and affections whence proceed sciences which may be called sciences as one would For what a man had rather were true he more readily believes Therefore he rejects difficult things from impatience of research sober things because they narrow hope the deeper things of nature from superstition the light of experience from arrogance and pride lest his mind should seem to be occupied with things mean and transitory things not commonly believed out of deference to the opinion of the vulgar Numberless in short are the ways and sometimes imperceptible in which the affections colour and infect the understanding\nL\nBut by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness incompetency and deceptions of the senses in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it though they be more important Hence it is that speculation commonly ceases where sight ceases insomuch that of things invisible there is little or no observation Hence all the working of the spirits inclosed in tangible bodies lies hid and unobserved of men So also all the more subtle changes of form in the parts of coarser substances which they commonly call alteration though it is in truth local motion through exceedingly small spaces is in like manner unobserved And yet unless these two things just mentioned be searched out and brought to light nothing great can be achieved in nature as far as the production of works is concerned So again the essential nature of our common air and of all bodies less dense than air which are very many is almost unknown For the sense by itself is a thing infirm and erring neither can instruments for enlarging or sharpening the senses do much but all the truer kind of interpretation of nature is effected by instances and experiments fit and apposite wherein the sense decides touching the experiment only and the experiment touching the point in nature and the thing itself\nLI\nThe human understanding is of its own nature prone to abstractions and gives a substance and reality to things which are fleeting But to resolve nature into abstractions is less to our purpose than to dissect her into parts as did the school of Democritus which went further into nature than the rest Matter rather than forms should be the object of our attention its configurations and changes of configuration and simple action and law of action or motion for forms are figments of the human mind unless you will call those laws of action forms\nLII\nSuch then are the idols which I call Idols of the Tribe and which take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit or from its preoccupation or from its narrowness or from its restless motion or from an infusion of the affections or from the incompetency of the senses or from the mode of impression\nLIII\nThe Idols of the Cave take their rise in the peculiar constitution mental or bodily of each individual and also in education habit and accident Of this kind there is a great number and variety but I will instance those the pointing out of which contains the most important caution and which have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding\nLIV\nMen become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them But men of this kind if they betake themselves to philosophy and contemplations of a general character distort and colour them in obedience to their former fancies a thing especially to be noticed in Aristotle who made his natural philosophy a mere bondservant to his logic thereby rendering it contentious and well nigh useless The race of chemists again out of a few experiments of the furnace have built up a fantastic philosophy framed with reference to a few things and Gilbert also after he had employed himself most laboriously in the study and observation of the loadstone proceeded at once to construct an entire system in accordance with his favourite subject\nLV\nThere is one principal and as it were radical distinction between different minds in respect of philosophy and the sciences which is this that some minds are stronger and apter to mark the differences of things others to mark their resemblances The steady and acute mind can fix its contemplations and dwell and fasten on the subtlest distinctions the lofty and discursive mind recognises and puts together the finest and most general resemblances Both kinds however easily err in excess by catching the one at gradations the other at shadows\nLVI\nThere are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns This however turns to the great injury of the sciences and philosophy since these affectations of antiquity and novelty are the humours of partisans rather than judgments and truth is to be sought for not in the felicity of any age which is an unstable thing but in the light of nature and experience which is eternal These factions therefore must be abjured and care must be taken that the intellect be not hurried by them into assent\nLVII\nContemplations of nature and of bodies in their simple form break up and distract the understanding while contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding a distinction well seen in the school of Leucippus and Democritus as compared with the other philosophies For that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure while the others are so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature These kinds of contemplation should therefore be alternated and taken by turns that so the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive and the inconveniences above mentioned with the idols which proceed from them may be avoided\nLVIII\nLet such then be our provision and contemplative prudence for keeping off and dislodging the Idols of the Cave which grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favourite subject or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish or out of partiality for particular ages or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated And generally let every student of nature take this as a rule  that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear\nLIX\nBut the Idols of the Marketplace are the most troublesome of all idols which have crept into the understanding through the alliances of words and names For men believe that their reason governs words but it is also true that words react on the understanding and this it is that has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistical and inactive Now words being commonly framed and applied according to the capacity of the vulgar follow those lines of division which are most obvious to the vulgar understanding And whenever an understanding of greater acuteness or a more diligent observation would alter those lines to suit the true divisions of nature words stand in the way and resist the change Whence it comes to pass that the high and formal discussions of learned men end oftentimes in disputes about words and names with which according to the use and wisdom of the mathematicians it would be more prudent to begin and so by means of definitions reduce them to order Yet even definitions cannot cure this evil in dealing with natural and material things since the definitions themselves consist of words and those words beget others so that it is necessary to recur to individual instances and those in due series and order as I shall say presently when I come to the method and scheme for the formation of notions and axioms\nLX\nThe idols imposed by words on the understanding are of two kinds They are either names of things which do not exist for as there are things left unnamed through lack of observation so likewise are there names which result from fantastic suppositions and to which nothing in reality corresponds or they are names of things which exist but yet confused and illdefined and hastily and irregularly derived from realities Of the former kind are Fortune the Prime Mover Planetary Orbits Element of Fire and like fictions which owe their origin to false and idle theories And this class of idols is more easily expelled because to get rid of them it is only necessary that all theories should be steadily rejected and dismissed as obsolete\nBut the other class which springs out of a faulty and unskilful abstraction is intricate and deeply rooted Let us take for example such a word as humid and see how far the several things which the word is used to signify agree with each other and we shall find the word humid to be nothing else than a mark loosely and confusedly applied to denote a variety of actions which will not bear to be reduced to any constant meaning For it both signifies that which easily spreads itself round any other body and that which in itself is indeterminate and cannot solidise and that which readily yields in every direction and that which easily divides and scatters itself and that which easily unites and collects itself and that which readily flows and is put in motion and that which readily clings to another body and wets it and that which is easily reduced to a liquid or being solid easily melts Accordingly when you come to apply the word  if you take it in one sense flame is humid if in another air is not humid if in another fine dust is humid if in another glass is humid So that it is easy to see that the notion is taken by abstraction only from water and common and ordinary liquids without any due verification\nThere are however in words certain degrees of distortion and error One of the least faulty kinds is that of names of substances especially of lowest species and welldeduced for the notion of chalk and of mud is good of earth bad a more faulty kind is that of actions as to generate to corrupt to alter the most faulty is of qualities except such as are the immediate objects of the sense as heavy light rare dense and the like Yet in all these cases some notions are of necessity a little better than others in proportion to the greater variety of subjects that fall within the range of the human sense\nLXI\nBut the Idols of the Theatre are not innate nor do they steal into the understanding secretly but are plainly impressed and received into the mind from the playbooks of philosophical systems and the perverted rules of demonstration To attempt refutations in this case would be merely inconsistent with what I have already said for since we agree neither upon principles nor upon demonstrations there is no place for argument And this is so far well inasmuch as it leaves the honour of the ancients untouched For they are no wise disparaged the question between them and me being only as to the way For as the saying is the lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one Nay it is obvious that when a man runs the wrong way the more active and swift he is the further he will go astray\nBut the course I propose for the discovery of sciences is such as leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits but places all wits and understandings nearly on a level For as in the drawing of a straight line or a perfect circle much depends on the steadiness and practice of the hand if it be done by aim of hand only but if with the aid of rule or compass little or nothing so is it exactly with my plan But though particular confutations would be of no avail yet touching the sects and general divisions of such systems I must say something something also touching the external signs which show that they are unsound and finally something touching the causes of such great infelicity and of such lasting and general agreement in error that so the access to truth may be made less difficult and the human understanding may the more willingly submit to its purgation and dismiss its idols\nLXII\nIdols of the Theatre or of Systems are many and there can be and perhaps will be yet many more For were it not that new for many ages mens minds have been busied with religion and theology and were it not that civil governments especially monarchies have been averse to such novelties even in matters speculative so that men labour therein to the peril and harming of their fortunes  not only unrewarded but exposed also to contempt and envy doubtless there would have arisen many other philosophical sects like to those which in great variety flourished once among the Greeks For as on the phenomena of the heavens many hypotheses may be constructed so likewise and more also many various dogmas may be set up and established on the phenomena of philosophy And in the plays of this philosophical theatre you may observe the same thing which is found in the theatre of the poets that stories invented for the stage are more compact and elegant and more as one would wish them to be than true stories out of history\nIn general however there is taken for the material of philosophy either a great deal out of a few things or a very little out of many things so that on both sides philosophy is based on too narrow a foundation of experiment and natural history and decides on the authority of too few cases For the Rational School of philosophers snatches from experience a variety of common instances neither duly ascertained nor diligently examined and weighed and leaves all the rest to meditation and agitation of wit\nThere is also another class of philosophers who having bestowed much diligent and careful labour on a few experiments have thence made bold to educe and construct systems wresting all other facts in a strange fashion to conformity therewith\nAnd there is yet a third class consisting of those who out of faith and veneration mix their philosophy with theology and traditions among whom the vanity of some has gone so far aside as to seek the origin of sciences among spirits and genii So that this parent stock of errors  this false philosophy  is of three kinds the Sophistical the Empirical and the Superstitious\nLXIII\nThe most conspicuous example of the first class was Aristotle who corrupted natural philosophy by his logic fashioning the world out of categories assigning to the human soul the noblest of substances a genus from words of the second intention doing the business of density and rarity which is to make bodies of greater or less dimensions that is occupy greater or less spaces by the frigid distinction of act and power asserting that single bodies have each a single and proper motion and that if they participate in any other then this results from an external cause and imposing countless other arbitrary restrictions on the nature of things being always more solicitous to provide an answer to the question and affirm something positive in words than about the inner truth of things a failing best shown when his philosophy is compared with other systems of note among the Greeks For the Homoeomera of Anaxagoras the Atoms of Leucippus and Democritus the Heaven and Earth of Parmenides the Strife and Friendship of Empedocles Heraclituss doctrine how bodies are resolved into the indifferent nature of fire and remoulded into solids have all of them some taste of the natural philosopher  some savour of the nature of things and experience and bodies whereas in the physics of Aristotle you hear hardly anything but the words of logic which in his metaphysics also under a more imposing name and more forsooth as a realist than a nominalist he has handled over again Nor let any weight be given to the fact that in his books on animals and his problems and other of his treatises there is frequent dealing with experiments For he had come to his conclusion before he did not consult experience as he should have done in order to the framing of his decisions and axioms but having first determined the question according to his will he then resorts to experience and bending her into conformity with his placets leads her about like a captive in a procession so that even on this count he is more guilty than his modern followers the schoolmen who have abandoned experience altogether\nLXIV\nBut the Empirical school of philosophy gives birth to dogmas more deformed and monstrous than the Sophistical or Rational school For it has its foundations not in the light of common notions which though it be a faint and superficial light is yet in a manner universal and has reference to many things but in the narrowness and darkness of a few experiments To those therefore who are daily busied with these experiments and have infected their imagination with them such a philosophy seems probable and all but certain to all men else incredible and vain Of this there is a notable instance in the alchemists and their dogmas though it is hardly to be found elsewhere in these times except perhaps in the philosophy of Gilbert Nevertheless with regard to philosophies of this kind there is one caution not to be omitted for I foresee that if ever men are roused by my admonitions to betake themselves seriously to experiment and bid farewell to sophistical doctrines then indeed through the premature hurry of the understanding to leap or fly to universals and principles of things great danger may be apprehended from philosophies of this kind against which evil we ought even now to prepare\nLXV\nBut the corruption of philosophy by superstition and an admixture of theology is far more widely spread and does the greatest harm whether to entire systems or to their parts For the human understanding is obnoxious to the influence of the imagination no less than to the influence of common notions For the contentious and sophistical kind of philosophy ensnares the understanding but this kind being fanciful and timid and half poetical misleads it more by flattery For there is in man an ambition of the understanding no less than of the will especially in high and lofty spirits\nOf this kind we have among the Greeks a striking example in Pythagoras though he united with it a coarser and more cumbrous superstition another in Plato and his school more dangerous and subtle It shows itself likewise in parts of other philosophies in the introduction of abstract forms and final causes and first causes with the omission in most cases of causes intermediate and the like Upon this point the greatest caution should be used For nothing is so mischievous as the apotheosis of error and it is a very plague of the understanding for vanity to become the object of veneration Yet in this vanity some of the moderns have with extreme levity indulged so far as to attempt to found a system of natural philosophy on the first chapter of Genesis on the book of Job and other parts of the sacred writings seeking for the dead among the living which also makes the inhibition and repression of it the more important because from this unwholesome mixture of things human and divine there arises not only a fantastic philosophy but also an heretical religion Very meet it is therefore that we be soberminded and give to faith that only which is faiths\nLXVI\nSo much then for the mischievous authorities of systems which are founded either on common notions or on a few experiments or on superstition It remains to speak of the faulty subjectmatter of contemplations especially in natural philosophy Now the human understanding is infected by the sight of what takes place in the mechanical arts in which the alteration of bodies proceeds chiefly by composition or separation and so imagines that something similar goes on in the universal nature of things From this source has flowed the fiction of elements and of their concourse for the formation of natural bodies Again when man contemplates nature working freely he meets with different species of things of animals of plants of minerals whence he readily passes into the opinion that there are in nature certain primary forms which nature intends to educe and that the remaining variety proceeds from hindrances and aberrations of nature in the fulfilment of her work or from the collision of different species and the transplanting of one into another To the first of these speculations we owe our primary qualities of the elements to the other our occult properties and specific virtues and both of them belong to those empty compendia of thought wherein the mind rests and whereby it is diverted from more solid pursuits It is to better purpose that the physicians bestow their labour on the secondary qualities of matter and the operations of attraction repulsion attenuation conspissation dilatation astriction dissipation maturation and the like and were it not that by those two compendia which I have mentioned elementary qualities to wit and specific virtues they corrupted their correct observations in these other matters  either reducing them to first qualities and their subtle and incommensurable mixtures or not following them out with greater and more diligent observation to third and fourth qualities but breaking off the scrutiny prematurely  they had made much greater progress Nor are powers of this kind I do not say the same but similar to be sought for only in the medicines of the human body but also in the changes of all other bodies\nBut it is a far greater evil that they make the quiescent principles wherefrom and not the moving principles whereby things are produced the object of their contemplation and inquiry For the former tend to discourse the latter to works Nor is there any value in those vulgar distinctions of motion which are observed in the received system of natural philosophy as generation corruption augmentation diminution alteration and local motion What they mean no doubt is this  if a body in other respects not changed be moved from its place this is local motion if without change of place or essence it be changed in quality this is alteration if by reason of the change the mass and quantity of the body do not remain the same this is augmentation or diminution if they be changed to such a degree that they change their very essence and substance and turn to something else this is generation and corruption But all this is merely popular and does not at all go deep into nature for these are only measures and limits not kinds of motion What they intimate is how far not by what means or from what source For they do not suggest anything with regard either to the desires of bodies or to the development of their parts it is only when that motion presents the thing grossly and palpably to the sense as different from what it was that they begin to mark the division Even when they wish to suggest something with regard to the causes of motion and to establish a division with reference to them they introduce with the greatest negligence a distinction between motion natural and violent a distinction which is itself drawn entirely from a vulgar notion since all violent motion is also in fact natural the external efficient simply setting nature working otherwise than it was before But if leaving all this any one shall observe for instance that there is in bodies a desire of mutual contact so as not to suffer the unity of nature to be quite separated or broken and a vacuum thus made or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of resuming their natural dimensions or tension so that if compressed within or extended beyond them they immediately strive to recover themselves and fall back to their old volume and extent or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of congregating towards masses of kindred nature  of dense bodies for instance towards the globe of the earth of thin and rare bodies towards the compass of the sky all these and the like are truly physical kinds of motion  but those others are entirely logical and scholastic as is abundantly manifest from this comparison\nNor again is it a less evil that in their philosophies and contemplations their labour is spent in investigating and handling the first principles of things and the highest generalities of nature whereas utility and the means of working result entirely from things intermediate Hence it is that men cease not from abstracting nature till they come to potential and uninformed matter nor on the other hand from dissecting nature till they reach the atom things which even if true can do but little for the welfare of mankind\nLXVII\nA caution must also be given to the understanding against the intemperance which systems of philosophy manifest in giving or withholding assent because intemperance of this kind seems to establish Idols and in some sort to perpetuate them leaving no way open to reach and dislodge them\nThis excess is of two kinds the first being manifest in those who are ready in deciding and render sciences dogmatic and magisterial the other in those who deny that we can know anything and so introduce a wandering kind of inquiry that leads to nothing of which kinds the former subdues the latter weakens the understanding For the philosophy of Aristotle after having by hostile confutations destroyed all the rest as the Ottomans serve their brothers has laid down the law on all points which done he proceeds himself to raise new questions of his own suggestion and dispose of them likewise so that nothing may remain that is not certain and decided a practice which holds and is in use among his successors\nThe school of Plato on the other hand introduced Acatalepsia at first in jest and irony and in disdain of the older sophists Protagoras Hippias and the rest who were of nothing else so much ashamed as of seeming to doubt about anything But the New Academy made a dogma of it and held it as a tenet And though theirs is a fairer seeming way than arbitrary decisions since they say that they by no means destroy all investigation like Pyrrho and his Refrainers but allow of some things to be followed as probable though of none to be maintained as true yet still when the human mind has once despaired of finding truth its interest in all things grows fainter and the result is that men turn aside to pleasant disputations and discourses and roam as it were from object to object rather than keep on a course of severe inquisition But as I said at the beginning and am ever urging the human senses and understanding weak as they are are not to be deprived of their authority but to be supplied with helps\nLXVIII\nSo much concerning the several classes of Idols and their equipage all of which must be renounced and put away with a fixed and solemn determination and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed the entrance into the kingdom of man founded on the sciences being not much other than the entrance into the kingdom of heaven whereinto none may enter except as a little child",

immanence in orient skies \nLong as pale mist and opalescent dyes\nHung on far isle or vanishing mountaincrest\nFields of remote enchantment can suggest\nSo sweet to wander in it matters nought\nThey

joys\nAnd ere the vanished pair of boys\nWere sent to sun her cot\nShe numbered near on sixty years\nAnd passed as elderly\nWhen in the street with flush of fears\nOn day discovered she\nFrom shine of

Square\nShe knocked but found her further stride\nChecked by a sergeant tall\nGay Granny whence come you he cried\nThis is a private ball\nNo one has more right here than me\nEre you were born man

footsteps died as she leant there\nLit by the morning star\nHanging above the moorland where\nThe aged elmrows are\nAnd as oernight from Pummery Ridge\nTo Maembury Ring and Standfast Bridge\nNo life stirred near or far\nThough inner mischief worked amain\nShe reached her husbands side\nWhere toilweary as he had lain\nBeneath the patchwork pied\nWhen yestereve shed forthward crept\nAnd as unwitting still he slept\nWho did in her confide\nA tear sprang as she turned and viewed\nHis features free from guile\nShe kissed him long as when just wooed\nShe chose his domicile\nDeath menaced now yet less for life\nShe wished than that she were the wife\nThat she had been erstwhile\nTime wore to six Her husband rose\nAnd struck the steel and stone\nHe glanced at Jenny whose repose\nSeemed

therefore interviews the commander on the spot and he responds badly telling her that Cicely was family something she wouldnt understand though he apologizes this sets the tone for their relationship throughout the rest of the book and the next C J Morse a reporter at Nadine Fursts station calls Eve afterwards pestering her with details about the case and a possible connection to Roarke Later Eve struggles between going back to her own apartment or Roarkes house she eventually gives in and goes to Roarkes At Roarkes home Summerset greets her caustically ironically remarking that he had no idea if she had intended to return Eventually Roarke joins Eve in the bath and tells her he loves her Eve does not reply irritated he changes the subject to the Towers case and the fact that Roarke has had business dealings with Towers which Eve construes to be possibly illegal Roarke brings up Eves refusal to move in with him and commit to their relationship Later that night while Eve is sleeping Roarke reorganizes and sells all of his remaining illegal businesses The next morning C J Morse implies that there is a coverup involved in Towers death by Eve and Whitney The extra publicity irritates Eve particularly because since Naked in Death and her relationship with Roarke she has unwillingly become very famous It is another source of tension between her and Roarke Afterwards Roarke leaves on business to Australia and Eve revenges herself against Morse by feeding the Towers story to Nadine Furst Eve goes to a club nearby the scene of the crime the Down and Dirty Here she meets Crack the proprietor who mistakes her for a stripper He gives her enough information for cash to track down where Towers had apparently scheduled a meeting Eve finds out that Towers had had an umbrella that night which was not recovered Ryan Feeney has been unofficially instructed by the commander to aid the case Feeney comments on how glamorous Eve looks in the media when out with Roarke then further prods by making cracks about how married they seem Later Nadine overhears Roarke tell Eve that he loves her and bothers her about it as well Eve is uncomfortable with Roarkes feelings feeling pressured to return them After some nonprogression in the case Eve returns to her own apartment that night Roarke surprises her in her sleep having returned from Australia The morning after Roarke is struggling to control his resentment over the fact that Eve had not returned to his home On their separate ways out Roarke presents Eve with an enormous diamond that he bought impulsively at an auction in Australia Terrified of what it represents Eve starts a fight with Roarke which he ends with an ultimatum for her to commit fully to their relationship At Towers funeral are her children David and Mirina Angelini their father and oddly enough Morse Also at the funeral is Roarke who tells Eve that Mirinas fiance is hiding a gambling and prostitution scandal Eve researches it and discovers that Roarke sold the casino where it took place the day after Towers death Roarke refuses to tell her that he did it for her Another victim is found murdered by the same MO an actress named Yvonne Metcalf whose shoe is missing C J Morse is already on the scene filming the womans dead body He snidely informs Eve that Metcalf used to have a relationship with Roarke Unable to find any connections between the victims Eve heads to Dr Charlotte Miras office Mira tells Eve that the killer hates women and wants to be famous hence going after women who have what he wants Mira also points out that these two women had a connection with Roarke offended Eve asks her if she thinks that Roarke is the killer Mira tells Eve that she is not in love with a murderer Eve tells her that shes having flashbacks of her time in Dallas After trying to relax Eve heads to Roarkes house bypasses Summerset by elbowing him and makes her way to Roarkes office ostensibly to interview him about Metcalf The two have a hostile interview finally Eve turns to leave Roarke locks the door but before he can say anything Eve turns to him shows that shes wearing the diamond which she will wear underneath her clothing for the rest of the series tells him that shell move in with him and that she loves him Eve tells Roarke that the killer is stalking famous women He is unhappy to find that Eve has decided to capitalize on this by becoming bait Nadine promises to help this by delivering as much media attention as possible but the scheme doesnt work Roarke who has to leave on another business

inviting over another man but surprisingly enough he likes Mavis very much and for the rest of the books is unusually kind and attentive to her That night one of Nadines editors Louise Kirski goes out in Nadines hooded raincoat and is murdered C J Morse finds her body At the scene of the crime is Officer Delia Peabody the attending It becomes quite clear that Nadine was the intended victim Security tapes show that David Angelini was at the scene of the crime further research reveals that he had a failed business deal with Yvonne Metcalf During interview he tries to bribe her he also says that he had seen Louise Kirski get murdered before running away Believing him the murderer but without physical evidence she arrests him for some minor charges Whitney asks her to release David on his own recognizance but she denies him he tells her she lacks compassion and dismisses her A search of Angelinis house uncovers a longhandled blade spotted with blood after seeing the knife Marco Angelini falsely confesses to the murder in an attempt to take the blame for his son However he sticks to his story in interview even when Whitney personally interrogates him Whitney finally realizes the stress and anger hes subjected Eve to and tries to alleviate the situation and after Mirina Angelini interrupts them he tries to apologize but Eve rejects it and leaves Eve and Roarke have a night in Mexico on their return Eve finds that the lab has tested Davids knife as being negative for the murder weapon The new police chief Harrison Tibble tells her to release David and Marcus on lack of evidence He adds that that there is too much emotion involved in this case lightly censuring both her and Whitney Afterwards Eve finds out that Nadine is missing Eve reviews Morses police interview and realizes that he lied about how he found Louise Kirskis body Further research incriminates him as having possibly murdered his mother At the studio however Morse is missing Eve requests Peabody as her backup and they search Morses apartment where Peabody finds the missing umbrella and shoe Waiting for news on Morse or Nadine Eve is stuck at Roarkes fundraiser when Summerset informs her of a private call which turns out to be Morse holding Nadine hostage He gives her six minutes to make it to Central Park she leaves without telling anyone and when Roarke realizes that Eve is gone he replays Eves last call and leaves to follow her During the fight with Morse Eve miscalculates and gives him the upper hand Before he can kill her Roarke intervenes and saves her and the knife instead stabs Morse in the throat It is not clear whether or not this was accidental or intentional on Roarkes part Roarke proposes to Eve as they walk away from the scene In Immortal in Death Morse is

border because he has no interstate visa to get across and will take sometime for him to get one Krysta Now tells Fortunio that she can get him a visa and to meet her at a bar called Buffalo Bills situated at the border Fortunio leaves the boat and drives towards the border On his way he finds Boxer passed out on the road He pulls over and approaches him Boxer stirs and says I am a pragmatic prevaricator with a propensity for oratorical seniority which is too pleonastical to be expeditiously assimilated by any of your unequivocal veracities Fortunio puts him inside the car and they begin to drive off again Fortunio asks Boxer how and what he was doing out in the middle of the desert Boxer doesnt know and asks the date He seems to suffer from amnesia At the same time a Nevada park ranger is tipped off about the whereabouts of an abandoned SUV with a burnedup dead body inside The SUV is a prototype vehicle belonging to Treer which is powered by Fluid Karma The vehicle and corpse is taken away to a facility nearby The facility is broken into by armedmen killing everyone inside and taking the SUV and corpse Fortunio asks Boxer if he can remember anything The only thing he seems to remember is a maze made of sand Fortunio says that he is a big fan of Boxers Boxer is confused and doesnt know what hes talking about Fortunio tells him that he is Boxer Santarosa very famous action star and exprofootball player He then tells him of the incidents that occurred on July 4 2005 The two make it to Buffalo Bills where Krysta Now is performing on stage but instead of stripping she begins to sing poetry Fortunio explains the situation to Krysta that he found Boxer lying in the desert picked him up and that he has amnesia so now he needs two visas Krysta will get the visas on one conditionplay along a game she has created Using Boxers amnesia to her advantage she will tell Boxer that the two of them were together in Vegas for the weekend partying and working on a script that she wrote called The Power she was researching a character at Buffalo Bills her character in the movie is an intelligent dancer interested in astrophysics She then goes on to say that Fortunio has to pretend that he is a private detective and was hired to find Boxer and bring him to Krysta if he doesnt do it she will deliver him to the bookies in Vegas She ends up convincing the naive Boxer Apparently the script The Power was written solely by Krysta and that Boxer never had anything to do with it to begin with but she has convinced him that he is starring in and directing the film He asks what it is about and who he plays Krysta says that Boxer plays a renegade LAPD cop called Jericho Kane and that it revolves around the end of the world She gives him a copy of the script to read Krysta begins talking to Fortunio outside her hotel room She tells him to contact a lawyer and have him draw up a short form contract for himself for The Power and to give himself 100000 to settle his debt with the bookies While Boxer is reading the script the phone begins to ring He answers and the woman on the other end tells him is this the Pragmatic PrevaricatorStay with the girl she is your only chance for survival We saw the Shadows of the Morning Light The Shadows of the Evening Sun Until the Shadows and Light were One Cross the Border At Dawn Stay with the Girl and whatever she says Keep Taking the Injections and whatever you dodo not board the roller coaster Krysta enters the room and asks about the script Boxer says he likes it but there is lots of work to be done on it Later Boxer signs the contract given to him by Fortunio and Krysta He goes to get a check from the bank he places his thumb on the scanner which is fed back to USIDent who are looking for Boxer Boxer tells Krysta about the phone call and of his dream in the desert she was in his dream and he remembers the song she sang in Buffalo Bills in the dream She tells him that they have to ride the roller coaster across the road from Buffalo Bills Boxer is hesitant at first but agrees He takes an injection before they go on Once they get to the top Boxer has a visiona vision of 1902 a NativeAmerica tribe standing there Boxer waves at one of them He seems to have created a rupture in the fourth dimension He goes back to 2008 all of a sudden and he tells Krysta about his vision The two of them exit the roller coaster together The book takes on a classical literature type of story the title Two Roads Diverge is from a famous poem by Robert Frost The cover from the book has a quote from T S Eliot stating that our world will not go out with a bang as we expect but with a whimper June 30 2008 Ronald Taverner is still on the houseboat with his father and cousin We learn that he is suffering from amnesia His father Tab brings him below deck to show him something Down there is his twin brotherRoland Taverner he is tied up to a chair Tab tells him that Ronald kidnapped his own brother to hide him up at the lake for several days His father tells him that he doesnt remember it because he hit his head which caused memory loss and he instructs him to keep taking the injections His brother Roland was drafted in the Iraqi War and was sent home to work for the UPU Urban Pacification Unit and uncovered a conspiracy and if the government found him they would get the information out of him They need Ronald to impersonate Roland for several days as a part of a mission to destroy USIDent He is to meet with a woman named Zora Carmichaels Cheri Oteria NeoMarxist a member of the revolution against USIDent in Venice Beach Zora takes Ronald and the tiedup Roland to Los Angeles July 1 2008 Boxer Santaros and Krysta Now finally arrive in Los Angeles They and Fortunio Balducci now a producer due to the contract signed in Buffalo Bills visit a friend of Krystas named Tawna McBride for research on the script She tells Boxer to remain in character the entire time Inside Tawna tells Krysta that her husband Rick died recently due to a drug overdose with the same syringe that Boxer had Boxer shows her the syringe he has and Tawna asks where he got it from and asks whether or not he volunteered for the program Rick was in the army and volunteered for a TopSecret program and that the weeks leading up to his death Rick began to act crazy wandering off into the desert in the middle of the night saying that he was going to see the Chief This makes Boxer feel unpleasant so he goes to use the bathroom Inside the bathroom a character in the mirror begins talking to Boxer  He keeps asking Boxer Do You BleedNot Like we Do FutureMan Boxer asks who the Indian is The man says that the Indian is a natural bleeder and that it took long to make contact he took a shot of Fluid Karma The name of the substance inside the syringes The Indian is a natural bleeder he sees forward in time and the man in the mirror and Boxer are Chemical Bleeders they see back in time but when Chemical Bleeders take Fluid Karma too much they begin to see both waysthis is why the man in the mirror is seeing into the futureat Boxer He is 6 months behind in January 2008 The man asks if is he sleeping with Tawna and asks where he is He then begins to recognize Boxer and his films The man in the mirror is Rick Tawnas husband Boxer tells him that he is dead Rick doesnt believe him and he takes a shot of Fluid Karma and he then falls to the ground and dies Boxer comes rushing out telling Tawna that he saw her husband die and that he was a part of it She becomes very upset and she kicks them out of her house Boxer then faints and falls onto the ground Boxer seems to be dreaming he is in a big maze All of a sudden a giant snake appears from behind him and it begins to chase Boxer around the maze Boxer runs up a set of stairs and into a portal He lands on the other side and sees Ronald standing there Ronald asks Boxer who he isBoxer calls himself Jericho Kane All of a sudden Ronald wakes up from his dream He is still with Zora in her van driving into Los Angeles He begins to describe the dream for her In the Treer Plaza Inga von Westphalen and two fellow scientists are discussing an experiment that they are conducting several people involved in it is the Taverner twins and Boxer Boxer was apparently guided to Krysta for a reason which we dont know yet Krysta was part of the experiment also because of her psychic abilities They believe that her script The Power is a guide map for the experiment and a work of prophecy They administered Fluid Karma into Krystas system hypnotised her and also had her read the entire Book of Revelation then they told her to create a document that would detail the final three days on Earth before the apocalypse Inga gets a telephone call from Zora who tells her that Ronald has experienced his first Fluid Karma dream Krysta takes Boxer and Fortunio to a barnyard outside of Los Angeles where many NeoMarxists are attending a huge party They meet up with Jimmy Hermosa who leads them into his tattoo parlour Krysta tells Boxer that this is where he will become Jericho Kane He is getting numerous tattoos all over his body At the same time Ronald and Zora arrive at the barn and she introduces Ronald to Dream and Dion The leaders of the NeoMarxist movement Moments later Boxer Santaros is introduced to the crowd who cheer wildly Ronald is shockedits Jericho Kane from his dream July 2 2008 Madeline Frost Santaros Mandy Moore daughter of the current Senator calls her father and tells him that Boxer Santaros has been missing for several days She and Boxer were married for several years If word got out of his disappearance it would effectively ruin Senator Bobby Frosts chances of being reelected June 27 2008 Boxer and Madeline are at a Charity Scavenger Hunt sponsored by Treer They are guests of honour at it Before they go out on stage Madeline gets pissed off as to why they would be associating with a nutjob like Baron Von Westphalen But Vaughn Westhouse Hollywood advisor to the ElliotFrost campaign and Boxers agent gets her to get out on stage or he will tell Boxer that she is having an affair with her assistant  Brandt Huntington Boxer goes out on stage and talks about the Scavenger Hunt whoever finds the last mechanical ball remote antennas for the energy fields buried underneath the ground will win a brand new SUV powered by Fluid Karma A person is at the area where the first ball is buried and where Boxer is expected to arrive with the first clue The persons mission is to kidnap Boxer and abandon him in the desert July 3 2008 Back at the Treer Plaza General Teena MacArthur was inspecting the body found in the burntup SUV so she calls a long friend named Simon Theory Kevin Smith to help her Ronald Taverner Zora Carmichaels Dream and Dion are having breakfast at their restaurant He wants them to bring himself and his brother to a hospital believing that there is something wrong with both of them The NeoMarxists explain their plan to Ronald They show him The Power script They are going to get him to go on a ridealong with Boxer for preparation and research for his character Dion and Dream are going to stage a dispute that Ronald will have to go investigate and pretend to shoot them both deadand all on Boxers video camera At Fortunio Balduccis house he is reading the script when Serpentine a mistress of the Barons calls him and tells him to facilitate a meeting between Ronald Taverner and Boxer and in return she will pay him for it At the NeoMarxist HQ Roland Taverner is tied up and injected with Fluid Karma The unconscious Roland begins singing All These Things That Ive DoneThe Killers They inject him once more and he stops Ronald finds a letter belonging to his brother from someone called Pilot Abilene He asks Zora what he was She tells him that he was an actor in a comedy troupe and he met Zora Dion and Dream where they became The Lighthouse Gang Pilot Abilene is a former soldier who is now a guard of the generator dubbed Utopia Three at the Santa Monica Pier He was an actor who started out in an action movie with Boxer Santaros The film was very bad but he became wellknown from it but his career ended when he was drafted to Iraq It was here where he met Roland and the two became best friends They learn of an experiment called Serpentine Dream Theoryall they know is if they sign up for it you are used as a guinea pig but soon after you are sent home They go one night to visit Simon Theory who is in charge of the experiment He says no at first saying that it isnt for volunteers but changes his mind once they bribe him The next morning they are taken to a nearby airbase and each given an injection of Fluid Karma The next day the two are about to drop in from a helicopter Pilot is nervous about it so Roland gives him his iPod to listen to during the dropthe song is All These Things That I Have Done They drop successfully and they infiltrate a building where their telepathy kicks inthe drug is working on them Roland is in a state of dementia so he throws a grenade into a room which explodes right next to Pilot which sends shrapnel into the left side of his face They never saw each other after that day The NeoMarxists are holding another meeting this time a lottery for thumbs certain people will be selected to have their thumb cut off to rig the election they can reuse the same thumb as many times as possible turning the election in their favour Ronald Zora Dion and Dream are in attendance The winner is Bing Zinneman who receives a check for 50000 and then had his thumb cut off his hand Afterward Krysta Now and her friends and colleagues Sheena Gee Shoshanna Cox and Deena Storm are in the middle of a conversation Krysta tells her three colleagues that she booked a gig on the MegaZeppelin for the Baron on July 4th While this is happening Boxer is walking the beaches of Venice during the night He takes out the Fluid Karma syringe and injects himselfbefore he loses conscious he murmurs Three DaysThree Final Days After Krysta leaves the bar where she was talking with her friends she is cornered by Fortunio He tells her to tell him everything about Serpentine Dream Theory She says that Serpentine is The Great Mistress of the Great Wizard who some call the AntiChrist Revelation 225  For It Will Never Be Night Again And They Would Not Need Lamp Light Or Sunlight For the Lord God Will Be Shining On ThemAnd They Shall Reign Forever and Ever", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-punct", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

stand\nAnf the yells of the clever division\nOf Any price Pardon were grand\nWe still had a chance for the money\nTwo heats remained to be run\nIf both fell to us  why my sonny\nThe clever division were done\nAnd Pardon was better we reckoned\nHis sickness was passing away\nSo we went to the post for the second\nAnd principal heat of the day\nTheyre off and away with a rattle\nLike dogs from the leashes let slip\nAnd right at the back of the battle\nHe followed them under the whip\nThey gained ten good lengths on him quickly\nHe dropped right away from the pack\nI tell you it made me feel sickly\nTo see the blue jacket fall back\nOur very last hope had departed \nWe thought the old fellow was done\nWhen all of a sudden he started\nTo go like a shot from a gun\nHis chances seemed slight to embolden\nOur hearts but with teeth firmly set\nWe thought Now or never The old un\nMay reckon with some of em yet\nThen loud rose the warcry for Pardon\nHe swept like the wind down the dip\nAnd over the rise by the garden\nThe jockey was done with the whip\nThe field was at sixes and sevens \nThe pace at the first had been fast \nAnd hope seemed to drop from the heavens\nFor Pardon was coming at last\nAnd how he did come It was splendid\nHe gained on them yards every bound\nStretching out like a greyhound extended\nHis girth laid right down on the ground\nA shimmer of silk in the cedars\nAs into the running they wheeled\nAnd out flashed the whips on the leaders\nFor Pardon had collared the field\nThen right through the ruck he was sailing \nI knew that the battle was won \nThe son of Haphazard was failing\nThe Yattendon filly was done\nHe cut down The Don and The Dancer\nHe raced clean away from the mare \nHes in front Catch him now if you can sir\nAnd up went my hat in the air\nThen loud fron the lawn and the garden\nRose offers of Ten to one on\nWholl bet on the field I back Pardon\nNo use all the money was gone\nHe came for the third heat lighthearted\nAjumping and dancing about\nThe others were done ere they started\nCrestfallen and tired and worn out\nHe won it and ran it much faster\nThan even the first I believe\nOh he was the daddy the master\nWas Pardon the son of Reprieve\nHe showed em the method of travel \nThe boy sat still as a stone \nThey never could see him for gravel\nHe came in hardheld and alone\n      \nBut hes old  and his eyes are grown hollow\nLike me with my thatch of the snow\nWhen he dies then I hope I may follow\nAnd go where the racehorses go\nI dont want no harping nor singing \nSuch things with my style dont agree\nWhere the hoofs of the horses are ringing\nTheres music sufficient for me\nAnd surely the thoroughbred horses\nWill rise up again and begin\nFresh faces on faraway courses\nAnd praps they might let me slip in\nIt would look rather well the racecard on\nMongst Cherubs and Seraphs and things\nAngel Harrisons black gelding Pardon\nBlue halo white body and wings\nAnd if they have racing hereafter\nAnd who is to say they will not\nWhen the cheers and the shouting and laughter\nProclaim that the battle grows hot\nAs they come down the racecourse asteering\nHell rush to the front I believe\nAnd youll hear

{"id": 6106, "text": " The book opens with an extract from The Book of Dreams which contains the imaginative writings of Howard Alan Treesong during his unhappy childhood Among other things it details the adventures of Seven Paladins who are key to the fantasy world he devises Gersens pursuit of Treesong begins after a conversation with an Interworld Police Coordinating Commission IPCC contact who remarks that the arch criminal has been quiet as of late Some years earlier he made himself Lord of the Overmen or King of Thieves in less grandiose language and as recently as three years ago he almost engineered his appointment as head of the IPCC itself Gersen and his friend grudgingly admire Treesongs ambition to control the criminal underworld and the Oikumenes sole interstellar police agency at the same time Gersen concludes that Treesong must be due for another grand gesture any time soon but admits to himself he possesses insufficient imagination to visualize what it could be His extensive business empire managed by Jehan Addels includes Cosmopolis magazine for which he often masquerades as the journalist Henry Lucas Gersen spends some time examining the Cosmopolis files for any material relating to Treesong He is on the point of giving up when he discovers a photograph apparently of a formal dinner bearing the words H A Treesong is here No other likeness of Treesong is known to exist  and the woman who had sold it to the magazine had apparently been killed for it But there is no way to tell which of the people in the picture is Treesong so Gersen devises a plan to unmask him He launches Extant a livelier sister magazine to Cosmopolis He then publishes the picture in the free inaugural issue as part of a contest offering large cash prizes to anyone who can first identify any or all of the ten people in the photograph An attractive redhaired young woman Alice Wroke seeks temporary employment processing the contest entries Gersen expecting an attempt at infiltration by Treesong covertly uses a lie detector on her and confirms his suspicions Eventually each of the subjects is identified except for one man who seems to have a variety of identities When a contestant submits the correct identification for all ten Gersen confronts Alice and places most of his cards on the table that the photograph was intended to identify Treesong and that the magazine would be interested in interviewing him However he conceals his personal interest Information from the contest leads Gersen to suspect the photograph is of the highestranking Fellows of the powerful Institute It includes seven members of the Dexad the Fellows of ranks 101 to 109 and 111 and the three Fellows of rank 99 ranks 100 and 110 are always vacant All save one died at the banquet poisoned by charnay see below The survivor is the man of many names  Treesong himself clearly the murderer of the others Having fraudulently acquired the rank of 99 he plans to become the Institutes leader the Triune rank 111 hence the name by default Three members of the Dexad were not present One had died recently the banquet was for choosing his successor from the 99s Another had broken with the Institute and become a hermit The last was Alice Wrokes father Treesong under a false name blackmailed Alice into spying on the contest by threats to her father whom he had in fact already murdered Gersen locates the last surviving member of the Dexad just ahead of Treesong and saves him in the process shooting Treesong in the leg The new Triune immediately cancels Treesongs spurious rank and brings to an end another plan that would have put the Demon Prince in a position of immense power Extant receives a late entry to the contest from someone who identifies Treesong as Howard Hardoah from Maunish on the planet Mouderveldt and claims to be his father The letter also mentions a school reunion to which Howard has been invited Treesong himself calls the Extant offices and identifies the people in the photograph only to be told that all have been named already and that he is too late to claim a prize Henry Lucas offers to publish Treesongs memoirs but Treesong says he has somewhere to go immediately Gersen suspects that Treesong plans to attend the school reunion Gersen travels to Maunish He interviews the elder Hardoah with the excuse of delivering a prize check and learns about Treesongs boyhood He also meets Howards older brother Ledesmus who hid Howards prized Book of Dreams an exercise book in which he wrote his childhood fantasies and tells of Howards nearmurder of his childhood friend Nymphotis Cleadhoe when he thought Nymphotis had taken it Ledesmus recovers the book and sells it to Gersen Gersen contacts Treesongs onetime music teacher and pays for his orchestras appearance at the reunion  with Gersen as a member though an afternoons lesson leaves him a thoroughly inept musician His guess is correct Treesong arrives accompanied by a band of menacing underlings and perpetrates imaginative though nonfatal humiliations on those who had tormented him Treesongs admittedly good musical ear is offended by Gersens poor playing so he has him thrown out Out of sight Gersen dispatches the men assigned to take him away and uses their weapons This is enough to disrupt Treesongs revenge but Gersen can do no more than inflict another wound before he has to flee In a second interview with the Hardoahs he learns that the Cleadhoes moved offplanet and their destination Otho Cleadhoe was township marmelizer  who transformed the flesh of corpses into a stony substance after which the resulting marmel statue was placed in the cemetery He still has the Book and finds there a description of Treesongs Seven Paladins On broaching the subject with Alice who is now his confederate he learns that Treesong considers the Seven to be the embodiments of various aspects of his own personality with Immir representing normal self Gersen concludes that the Book would probably lure Treesong out of hiding He finds willing but difficult allies in Nymphotis Cleadhoes parents Otho and Tuty  whose only child is dead and they have no doubt that Howard killed him Gersen has Cosmopolis publish a sensationalized report of Treesongs exploits at the reunion and a letter purportedly from Tuty in which she talks fondly of Howard as their sons friend and casually mentions an exercise book she still has in her possession As hoped this draws Treesongs attention The Cleadhoes now live on the jungle planet of Bethune Preserve Treesong comes in search of his precious book Tuty and Otho lure Treesong to their remote outpost but doublecross Gersen leaving him and Alice behind Gersen and Alice manage to borrow a vehicle to follow in but arrive late They are shown into Othos laboratory and museum Otho has marmelized Treesongs legs and left him seated in an indoor garden facing the marmel of Nymphotis Gersen reveals his motivation for seeking the last Demon Princes downfall The archvillain wearily acknowledges himself to have been neatly trapped mourns the narrow failure of his attempt to make himself the first Emperor of the Gaean Worlds and asks to be left alone Gersen declines to take any further revenge on him and leaves with Alice and the Cleadhoes From behind the door Gersen overhears a conversation as between ImmirTreesong and his paladins in which the lesser paladins bid farewell to their leader and gradually convince him that the situation is truly hopeless Before they depart the paladins perform one last service for Immir A crash and a splash are heard Gersen hurries back inside to find Treesong face down and drowned in a pond before the overturned chair though he should have been unable to rise from it and it had been solidly secured Gersen his revenge complete finds himself at a loss He confesses to Alice that he does not know what he will do now that he has been deserted by his enemies", "extra":

Rhisiarts house where he will have contact with Annest John meekly complies Cadfael meanwhile realises that Engelards arrow did not kill Rhisiart It had rained for an hour about noon Rhisiarts back on which he lay is damp while his front is dry Rhisiart was stabbed from behind by a dagger which penetrated through his body and fell face down Some time later after it rained someone turned him over and pushed the arrow into the wound from the front For the moment Cadfael can only speculate why anyone would do this Although the monks from Shrewsbury all appear to have alibis for the time of Rhisiarts death Columbanus confesses the next morning to sleeping rather than praying all the previous day making Jerome a suspect Father Huw tells Robert that his flock have taken Rhisiarts death as an omen and no longer oppose Winefrides removal Robert declares that he will exhume the remains only after three nights vigil and prayer Cadfael takes advantage of the superstition that a corpse will bleed afresh if touched by the murderer though he does not believe it himself having seen men who died in battle being handled by those who killed them At his suggestion Sioned asks that after each nights prayer the two who maintained the vigil place their hand upon Rhisiarts heart in token of forgiveness On the first morning Jerome appears to hesitate but eventually does as Sioned asks The next night Robert excuses himself from the vigil on the pretext of relating the recent events to Prince Owains bailiff On the third night Cadfael and Columbanus share the vigil but Columbanus once again has a fit of religious ecstasy and is carried off unconscious in the morning He recovers after Mass and relates that Winefride appeared once again to him and said that Rhisiart should be buried in her grave when she is removed They begin digging out Winefrides grave Cadfael finds the body several feet down and the monks carefully place it in the coffin brought from Shrewsbury Prior Robert places wax seals on the coffin to prevent anyone from disturbing the contents As they prepare to bury Rhisiart in her place Sioned asks Peredur another young man who has been in love with her to place a jewelled cross on the body Peredur refuses terrified and claims that Rhisiart cannot accuse him He confesses that he found Rhisiart dead and pushed one of Engelards arrows into the wound thinking that Engelard would flee into England and thus remove himself as rival for Sioneds hand Shocked by these revelations Peredurs mother Branwen becomes hysterical Cadfael had previously prepared a flask of a tranquilising syrup derived from poppies in case of further hysterical fits by Columbanus He retrieves it from Columbanuss belongings and finds most of it is gone though enough remains to calm Branwen He then recalls that on the day of Rhisiarts murder Columbanus confessed to sleeping while at vigil but only Jerome drank some of the wine provided for sustenance Had it been laced with the syrup Jerome would almost certainly have slept through the vigil but would have been ashamed to admit it Cadfael is distracted from this train of thought by the news that the Princes bailiff is about to take John into custody When the bailiff arrives at Sioneds dwelling he is met by Cai who is wearing a bloodstained bandage and says that John broke free after striking him with a board Though Robert is displeased the bailiff Cai Bened and Annest all seem rather complacent over the escape On the last night before the monks depart Columbanus who Sioned and Cadfael reckon is taking the glory of the translation of the saint for himself offers to mount another solitary vigil As he believes himself to be unobserved he composes himself to sleep He is awakened by the vision of a young woman demanding to know why he murdered Rhisiart her champion Unnerved Columbanus confesses and begs forgiveness from the saint saying that the deed was for her glory As she calls him a liar Columbanus realises that the saint is actually Sioned and slashes at her with a knife inflicting only a graze before fleeing Cadfael and Engelard tackle him outside the chapel Seeing Sioned bleeding from her wounds an enraged Engelard hurls Columbanus to the ground hard enough to break his neck Faced with this unexpected development Cadfael recalls Sioneds inspired words about Rhisiart being her champion He Engelard and Sioned quickly undress Columbanus open St Winifredes coffin replace the remains of the saint in her grave above Rhisiarts body and place Columbanuss naked body in the coffin Cadfael uses his knowledge of seals and more importantly how to inconspicuously break them to give the appearance that the coffin remained undisturbed The three then prepare the chapel for discovery in the morning The next morning Columbanuss shirt and habit are found empty on the floor of the chapel Hawthorn petals are scattered around them Though some wonder whether Columbanus has gone mad and is wandering naked Robert proclaims that Columbanuss prayers to be taken from the world into a state of grace have been answered The villagers help load the saints suspiciously heavy coffin aboard a cart without any outward sign that anything is wrong yet Cadfael suspects that every one of them knows what happened during the night As they leave Gwytherin John can be seen by Cadfael bidding them farewell Two years later Bened the smith from Gwytherin calls at Shrewsbury Abbey while on a pilgrimage to Walsingham He tells Cadfael that John and Annest are married and John will become the smith after Bened Sioned and Engelard are also married and have christened their first child Cadfael To Roberts chagrin he relates that what Robert fondly imagines to be Saint Winefrides former resting place in Gwytherin is the scene of many pilgrimages and miraculous cures when the ornate tomb in the Abbey is treated with indifference by pilgrims and apparently the saint herself Cadfael is left musing that the saint is unlikely to object to sharing a grave with Rhisiart", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-punct", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

was to make no inquiries respecting his family until he completed his twentyfifth year should live with them Alan was studying for the law but his companion had started for his first country ramble and the story commences with a long correspondence between them As he returned from fishing in the Solway Firth with Benjie as his instructor Darsie was overtaken by the tide and carried by Mr Herries dressed as a fisherman on horseback to a cottage where his niece Lilias said grace at suppertime and next morning he was placed under the guidance of Joshua Geddes The Quaker who was part owner of some fishing nets in the river invited him to spend a few days at his house and while there he heard from Alan that a young lady had called to warn him that his friend was in considerable danger and to urge that he should at once return to Edinburgh A letter however from old Mr Fairford determined him not to do so and having made acquaintance with the blind fiddler who told him a tale of the Redgauntlet family Darsie went with him to a fishers merrymaking where he danced with Lilias who reproached him for leading an idle life and begged him to leave the neighbourhood Mr Fairford had arranged that Peter Peebles an eccentric plaintiff should be his sons first client and Alan was pleading the cause before the Lords Ordinary when his father by mistake handed him a letter from Mr Crosbie announcing that Darsie had mysteriously disappeared Alan instantly rushed out of court and started in search of his friend who had accompanied the Quaker to await an attack on his fishing station and been made prisoner by the rioters of whom Mr Herries was the leader After being nearly drowned and recovering from a fever he awoke in a strange room to which he was confined for several days when he was visited by his captor and conducted by him to an interview with Squire Foxley who acting as a magistrate declined to interfere with Mr Herries guardianship As the squire was leaving however Mr Peebles arrived to apply for a warrant against Alan for throwing up his brief and startled Mr Herries by recognising him as a Redgauntlet and an unpardoned Jacobite Darsie obtained a partial explanation from him and was told to prepare for a journey disguised as a woman Meanwhile Alan had applied to the provost and having obtained from his wifes relation Mr Maxwell a letter to Herries he started for Annan where under the guidance of Trumbull he took ship for Cumberland On landing at Crakenthorps inn he was transported by Nanty Ewart and a gang of smugglers to Fairladies House where he was nursed through a fever and introduced to a mysterious Father Buonaventure After being closely questioned and detained for a few days he was allowed to return with a guide to the inn Darsie was also travelling thither with Herries and his followers when he discovered that Lilias who accompanied them was his sister and learnt from her his own real name and rank He was also urged by his uncle to join a rising in favour of the Pretender and having hesitated to do so was detained in custody when they reached their destination where Alan as well as other visitors and several of the neighbouring gentry had already arrived He was then introduced to a conference of Charles Edward Stuarts adherents and afterwards to the prince himself who refused to agree to their conditions and decided to abandon the contemplated attempt in his favour Ewart was accordingly ordered to have his brig in readiness when Nixon suggested that he should turn traitor upon which they fought and killed each other Sir Arthur now learned that Fairford and Geddes were in the house but before he was allowed to see them they had been shown into the room where Lilias was waiting when Alan became aware that his fair visitor at Edinburgh was his friends sister and heard from her lips all the particulars of her brothers history Their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Benjie in whose pocket a paper was found indicating that Nixon had communicated with the Government and during the confusion which ensued the Hanoverian General Campbell arrived unarmed and unaccompanied and after explaining that the Jacobites had been betrayed weeks before announced that he was sufficiently supported with cavalry and infantry The Rebellion was over before it could begin His instructions however from King George were to allow all concerned in the plot to disperse and he intimated that as many as wished might embark in the vessel which was in waiting The Pretender was accordingly led by the Laird of Redgauntlet to the beach and Lilias offered to accompany her uncle in his voluntary exile This however he would not permit and after an exchange of courtesies with the general the

forest deep\nAnd toll on steadily a drowsiness\nCame on me so that I fell half asleep\nAs I sat there not moving less and less\nI saw the melted snow that hung in beads\nUpon my steelshoes less and less I saw\nBetween the tiles the bunches of small weeds\nHeartless and stupid with no touch of awe\nUpon me halfshut eyes upon the ground\nI thought O Galahad the days go by\nStop and cast up now

stone\nDismal unfriended what thing comes of it\nAnd what if Palomydes also ride\nAnd over many a mountain and bare heath\nFollow the questing beast with none beside\nIs he not able still to hold his

lovesorrow is\nSo dear a thing unto his constant heart\nThat even if he never win one kiss\nOr touch from Iseult it will never part\nAnd he will never know her to be worse\nThan in his happiest dreams he thinks she is\nGood knight and faithful you have scaped the curse\nIn wonderfulwise you have great store of bliss\nYea what if Father Launcelot ride out\nCan he not think of Gueneveres arms round\nWarm and lithe about his neck and shout\nTill all the place grows joyful with the sound\nAnd when he lists can often see her face\nAnd think Next month I kiss you or next week\nAnd still you think of me therefore the place\nGrows very pleasant whatsoever he seek\nBut me who ride alone some carle shall find\nDead in my arms in the halfmelted snow\nWhen all unkindly with the shifting wind\nThe thaw comes on at Candlemas I know\nIndeed that they will say This Galahad\nIf he had lived had been a right good knight\nAh poor chaste body but they will be glad\nNot most alone but all when in their sight\nThat very evening in their scarlet sleeves\nThe gaydressd minstrels sing no maid will talk\nOf sitting on my tomb until the leaves\nGrown big upon the bushes of the walk\nEast of the Palacepleasaunce make it hard\nTo see the minster therefrom welladay\nBefore the trees by autumn were well bared\nI saw a damozel with gentle play\nWithin that very walk say last farewell\nTo her dear knight just riding out to find\nWhy should I choke to say it the Sangreal\nAnd their last kisses sunk into my mind\nYea for she stood leand forward on his breast\nRather scarce stood the back of one dear hand\nThat it might well be kissd she held and pressd\nAgainst his lips long time they stood there fannd\nBy gentle gusts of quiet frosty wind\nTill Mador de la porte agoing by\nAnd my own

for I saw\nOne sitting on the altar as a throne\nWhose face no man could say he did not know\nAnd though the bell still rang he sat alone\nWith raiment half bloodred half white as snow\nRight so I fell upon the floor and knelt\nNot as one kneels in church when mass is said\nBut in a heap quite nerveless for I felt\nThe first time what a thing was perfect dread\nBut mightily the gentle voice came down\nRise up and look and listen Galahad\nGood knight of God for you will see no frown\nUpon my face I come to make you glad\nFor that you say that you are all alone\nI will be with you always and fear not\nYou are uncared for though no maiden moan\nAbove your empty tomb for Launcelot\nHe in good time shall be my servant too\nMeantime take note whose sword first made him knight\nAnd who has

ME sorry long day after day\nHer warm arms round his neck half throttle ME\nThe hot lovetears burn deep like spots of lead\nYea and the years pass quick right dismally\nWill Launcelot at one time hang his head\nYea old and shrivelld he shall win my love\nPoor Palomydes fretting out his soul\nNot always is he able son to move\nHis love and do it honour needs must roll\nThe proudest destrier sometimes in the dust\nAnd then tis weary work he strives beside\nSeem better than he is so that his trust\nIs always on what chances may betide\nAnd so he wears away my servant too\nWhen all these

the Limberlost Elnora faces cold neglect by her mother a woman who feels ruined by the death of her husband Robert Comstock who drowned in quicksand in the swamp Katharine blames Elnora for his death because her husband died while she gave birth to their daughter and could not come to his rescue The Comstocks make money by selling eggs and other farm products but Mrs Comstock refuses to cut down a single tree in the forest or to delve for oil as the neighbors around them are doing even though the added income would make their lives easier Elnora is just beginning high school where her unfashionable dress adds to her difficulty blending in with the other students She is determined to earn an education which her mother derides as useless Mrs Comstock wants Elnora to remain at home and work as a drudge on their farm Lack of money for tuition and books nearly derail her continued enrollment Her few comforts are the fact that she knows she can excel in school especially in math and her study of nature the kindness of her neighbours Wesley and Margaret Sinton that Freckles left her a valuable specimens box in the swamp and that she succeeds in her enterprising scheme to gather and sell artifacts and moths from the Limberlost which she can store in Freckless box without her mothers knowledge Elnora is smart and witty and she loves the outdoors her heart aches for returned love She soon makes many friends at school Eventually Elnora wins her mothers love but only after a few emotional disasters have stricken the Comstock women Firstly after succeeding in high school for some years she feels a yearning to play violin as her father had done Margaret Sinton is able to procure for her the very same violin that Robert Comstock used to play and Elnora becomes proficient at it She knows that her mother hates the violin without knowing why so she must conceal her proficiency Secondly when Elnora is in her final year of high school Wesley and Margaret insist that Katharine accompany them to the high school play Katharine has no interest in seeing what idiotic thing a pack of school children were doing But Katharine is curious about the high school she enters it to deride it then finds she admires it when she hears a violin playing she enters the school play and discovers Elnora playing as only a peculiar chain of circumstances puts it in the power of a very few to play Upon seeing Elnora playing her dead husbands violin to an enthusiastic audience and realizing that her world has changed irrevocably  The swamp had sent back the soul of her loved dead and put it into the body of the daughter she resented and it was almost more than she could endure and live  Katharine faints Thirdly a few days later Elnora believes her mother understands the necessity for her to graduate so that she can enter college or at least teach either of which she would love to do She instructs Katharine that she will need new dresses for Commencement and trusts her mother to supply them Mrs Comstock always antagonistically honest presents her with an old dress Elnora considers this an unforgivable betrayal a sign of her mothers disregard and lack of love for her That night Elnora must find a good dress elsewhere Fourthly Elnora has always concealed from her mother the fact that she can earn money by selling moths As she works through her final year of high school and hopes to go to college she finds that there is a single moth she must collect which will pay the way for her future In the central conflict of the novel Elnora sees her mother destroy that moth When she protests Mrs Comstock slaps her Elnora has always been patient but now she screams that she hates her mother and rushes out Mrs Comstock finally realizing how essential Elnora is to her stable home life sets out that night to replace the moth She worsens the situation a result which Elnora hides from her but when the Sintons discover that Mrs Comstock hit Elnora Margaret determines on an intervention She tells Katharine that she has been mourning for a husband who was promiscuous and planning to cheat on her With this news Katharine understands how she has neglected a loving talented daughter Elnora graduates and is now 19 years old A young man Philip Ammon arrives in town His uncle a doctor advised Phillip has been sent to Onabasha to recuperate from

and Bartleby have crash landed After Will has located his brothers dead body and given him a burial of sorts he and Chester carry the injured Elliott with them as they set about exploring this alien and frightening world The task of moving through the passages with the burden of Elliott and their equipment is made easier thanks to the reduced gravity at this depth in the Earth With the help of Bartlebys tracking ability they discover that there is someone else down there with them but are attacked by giant carnivorous creatures called spidermonkeys They are saved by the intervention of a new character called Martha She takes them to where she lives a shack evidently built by the survivors of a galleon which was sucked down the another of the giant holes like the Pore so she can tend to Elliott and protect the two boys Meanwhile the Rebecca twins who were pushed into the Pore by Sarah Jerome in her last dying act are aware that Will is alive and begin to plot against him with two Styx Special Forces soldiers called Limiters One of the Rebeccas and a Limiter approach Wills father Dr Burrows and attempt to bully him into finding them a way out of the Pore Dr Burrows seems to have very little comprehension that the Styx are dangerous and capable of great cruelty and murder Marthas Shack Part 2 At Marthas shack Elliotts condition deteriorates as she catches a voracious fever and Martha warns Will and Chester that her son died after the same thing happened when he injured himself on an expedition two years previously Much to Wills surprise the other Rebecca twin turns up alone the shack and her life is only spared after Will stops Chester and Martha from killing her The twin claims that she is innocent and has had to go along with her sisters evil plans Will appears to give her the benefit of the doubt but Chester and Martha are highly skeptical Will is further won over by the Rebecca twin as she gives him two phials which purportedly contain the Dominion virus and its antidote Elliotts condition worsens and Will and Chester discover that Martha has been less than honest with them and that there may be a source of modern medicines to help the girl Although Martha is reluctant for them to risk the long journey she eventually leads them to a metal ship which her son had stumbled across The Metal Ship Part 3 When they get there it turns out that the metal ship is actually a modern Russian nuclear submarine and they are forced to shelter inside it while Elliott responds to the antibiotics There is also the added risk that they may be attacked by Brights giant moth like flying creatures As they finally set off from the submarine the second Rebecca twin makes her appearance with Dr Burrows and the two Limiters Will realizes the twin who surrendered to him has been lying all the time as she orders Bartleby to attack him  the Hunter has been conditioned to follow her orders after being Darklit in the Colony One of the Limiters is killed by a Bright but the Rebeccas still have an edge Just when it appears as if all is lost Elliott reveals that she is half Styx and saves the day by priming one of the explosives from her rucksack In the subsequent explosion Will and his father are separated from Chester Elliott Martha and Bartleby while the Rebecca twins and the surviving Limiter seek refuge in the Russian submarine which is knocked down the giant hole it was in Smoking Jean by the explosion The Underground Harbor Part 4 Separated from his friends and not knowing whether they are alive or not Will is persuaded by his father to travel upwards and they stumble upon an underground harbour a deeplevel fallout shelter from the Cold War After Will has helped himself to various weapons from the armoury in the shelter they manage to get an outboard engine to work and attach it to a launch Then they travel up a subterranean river linking the fallout shelter to the surface and emerge in Norfolk from where they make their way back to Highfield and are reunited with Drake Highfield Again Part 5 Mrs Burrows Wills stepmother has gone through a transformation after she manages to beat her TV addiction and has returned to Highfield where she is kept under close surveillance by the Styx and their agents At Dr Burrows insistence Drake takes him to meet his wife so revealing to the Styx that Dr Burrows and Will are back Topsoil Then there follows a parting of the ways as Mrs Burrows remains on the surface with Drake who has asked Will to return back into the Earth and make sure that the risk of the Dominion virus has been neutralised Will is accompanied by his father as they retrace the their route to where the submarine was blasted from the ledge in Smoking Jean and he is reunited with Chester Martha and a fully recovered Elliott Departure Part 6 Drake with help from a squad of former SAS soldiers devises a plan to trap one of the leading Styx the old Styx using Mrs Burrows as bait But the mission fails and Mrs Burrows is captured and taken to the Colony where she is Darklit Meanwhile Dr Burrows in a literal leap of faith throws himself into the pore followed by his son and eventually by Elliott and Bartleby Dr Burrows assumption that the gravity further down the pore is progressively lower is proved to be correct and after locating the submarine they search for any surviving Styx Dr Burrows driven by his conviction that there is a world at the centre of the Earth risks all their lives as he makes sure that they have no option but to continue towards it They finally make it through to the Garden of the Second Sun  a hidden world at the centre of the Earth complete with its own sun mountains oceans and animals long since extinct on the surface Assisted by Will Dr Burrows begins to investigate one of three Mayantype pyramids they find there and it seems as though they are finally safe from the Styx until Elliott spots some footprints She Will and Bartleby follow the trail and discover that the Rebecca twins and a Limiter have also made it through to the hidden world After Elliott sets an ambush to deal with the Styx for once and for all Will disobeys her and sneaks in to retrieve the Dominion phials He is discovered by one of the Rebecca twins and in the firefight and explosion which follow both the Rebecca twins and Limiter perish while Will makes off

they can use the medical supplies on board to attempt to sustain Rachel Weintraub who is nearing the day of her death The Consul is reluctant to do so but finally relents only to find that the ship has been placed under interdict by Gladstone and the Hyperion authorities After this setback the pilgrims delegate Lamia and the poet Martin Silenus to travel to Keep Chronos and the Poets City for food Silenus goes to the Poets City to complete his Hyperion Cantos but is instead surprised by the Shrike and impaled on the Tree of Thorns which is revealed to be partially real Lamia at Keep

killed years previously but is not punished his sentence being to live during the turbulent times that the Ousters believe shall follow the war The Consul is then informed that there is no Ouster offensive against the WorldWeb and concludes that the TechnoCore is the only power capable of launching such an attack The Ousters then offer their support to the Hegemony in their struggle against the artificial intelligences of the TechnoCore but only in the form of retaliation for the fall of the Hegemony which they claim is inevitable since the Ousters refuse to use farcasters Gladstone who has resolved to use a TechnoCore device against the Ousters while Hegemony citizens temporarily evacuate and retreat into the labyrinths of the worlds containing those features is sent this information and also discovers that a FORCE autopsy of Ouster bodies found during a failed counterattack against the invasion armada reveals that the Ousters are truly TechnoCore cybrids Gladstone retires for a brief time and while napping is approached by Severn in a dream Having met with his creator Ummon Severn has discovered that the TechnoCore resides within the farcaster system fearing alien intelligences Lions and Tigers and Bears to be found in the Void Which Binds a reality thought of by the Hegemony as a communications medium Gladstone orders the immediate destruction of the

into coins With their purses full they return and meet Andine the queen of Osthos in her palace posing as slavers However Andine wont sell Eliar to them Emerald worms her way into Andines affection in an attempt to persuade her to give up EliarFinally the queen or Arya agrees to sell the other slaves along with Eliar With the deal struck Althalus leads his troupe out but overhears Eliar planning on attacking him with the other soldier slaves To break the soldiers loyalty he randomly picks a soldier and sends him several thousand feet into the air before bringing him back down and releasing the slaves except Eliar whom he keeps chained up In the morning Eliar decides that he will follow Althalus After buying some horses they head to Awes where Emerald tells Eliar that he must show the writing on the knife to every priest in Awes and ask if they can read it While doing this they discover an agent of Daeva who screams in anguish after seeing the knife Eliar quickly slays him and they hide the body under a pile of rocks Unfortunately a young priest finds them but it turns out that the priest is none other than the fourth member of their party Bheid With their new member ready Emerald reads the knife which leads them back to Osthos where their fifth member is destined to be none other that the queen of Osthos Andine Returning to Osthos they camp out behind the walls of the city for the night Formulating a plan Althalus and Emerald sneak into Andines palace unnoticed In her chambers Emerald captures Andine in a spell causing her to be little more than a puppet Leading their newest member out of the city they rejoin their group and decide to hastily leave before morning comes and Andine is discovered missing Unfortunately Andine wants no part in this and focuses on killing Eliar but the enchantment on the knife forces her to listen to Althalus and so with their newest member in tow the party travels to Hule to find their sixth member While traveling towards Hule Bheid tries to quell Andines hatred towards Eliar  with limited success it but appears to be taking effect when Andine refrains from making any scathing remarks towards Eliar During the night Althalus and Eliar hear someone sneaking towards their camp and capture the boy named Gher who it turns out is their sixth memberEmerald finally sorts out the problems with Andine by using Gher as a voice Andine having a change of heart helps clean up the beaten up Gher and they head to Kweron to find their final member a witch In Kweron Althalus and Emerald hatch up a scheme that involves Bheid Bheid will pretend that he has come to collect the witch for interrogation as well as predicting avalanches and lightning strikes which Althalus will provide Bheid is at first reluctant to so lie that blatantly about something but in the end he agrees After a conversation with the priests of the village he finds out that the witch is about to be burned alive Through the respect he has gathered by his forecasts he can convince the priests to give the enigmatic Leitha into his care Before leaving Leitha reveals that she can hear the thoughts of other people The group decides to travel back to the House at the end of the world Dweia reveals the origins of why they must do what they do Deiwos the Sky God  and Dweias brother  created the world and filled the planet with living things whom Dweia cares for However Daevas only role is to destroy parts of the universe but only those which Deiwos and Dweia allow him to Daeva tries to change this and has Ghend find each member of his chosen ones to prepare to take over the world and to do this he needs Deiwoss book to copy it and make a book of his own for this purpose After learning this Althalus introduces Emerald who in reality was Dweia all along to the family and quickly explains the situation to them as well as telling them about Eliars ability to use the doors of the House to travel through Spacetime After getting acquainted with living in the house they use the doors to return to Arum where they try to win Albrons the knife keepers clan as allies and show him the House as an act of trust They know that they will need an army to combat Geltas archaic forces from the past Calling a clan meeting they hire all the Arum clans and prepare themselves to fight against Geltas army Thanks to the more modern warfare of their time Geltas forces are easily crushed and although Eliar is injured with the help of to Althaluss powers the remaining part of the enemy forces is defeated Ultimately Ghend and Althalus face off in the House at the end of the world ending with the destruction of the Book of Daeva the defeat of Daeva and the saving of the universe frLa Rdemption dAlthalus nlDe kronieken van de eerste ijstijd ja

a year The Pendennises however claim descent from an ancient family and Arthurs uncle Major Pendennis though he has only his retired Army pay associates with wealthy and titled people As Pen and Laura grow up Mrs Pendennis tells them that she hopes they will marry someday At age 18 however Pen falls in love with an actress Emily Fotheringay a stage name who is about ten years his senior Emilys father Captain Costigan believes that Pen is rich and wants Pen to marry his daughter but Pens mother is horrified She summons Major Pendennis from London and the Major derails the marriage simply by telling Costigan that his nephew is not rich Emily jilts Pen Pen heartbroken leaves home to study at St Bonifaces college in Oxbridge There he lives extravagantly unwittingly causing his mother and Laura to live in near poverty After two years Pen fails his final examination and remorsefully returns home where unfortunately his mother and Laura easily forgive him and Laura sacrifices her small personal fortune to pay Pens debts He soon returns to Oxbridge retakes the exam and obtains a degree but returns to Fairoaks as his mother thinks earning a living is both beneath her son and harmful to his health Soon a large house in the neighbourhood that has stood empty for years is reoccupied by its owners the Clavering family consisting of Sir Francis a baronet and Member of Parliament addicted to gambling his rich and kindly but lowborn wife whose father earned his fortune in India their young son and Lady Claverings daughter from her first marriage Blanche Amory The Pendennises become friendly with the Claverings and Pen is infatuated with Blanche but the flirtation doesnt last long To please his mother Pen at this point languidly proposes to Laura but she turns him down essentially because she thinks hes not mature enough Pen then sets out for London where he meets George Warrington a journalist with whom Pen takes cheap lodgings and who helps Pen get started as a writer Pen achieves some success and starts to support himself swearing hell take no more of his mothers or Lauras money The Clavering family also comes up to London where they live very well and where Blanche continues to flirt with Pen and many other men One of them Pens college friend Henry Foker falls in love with Blanche but cannot propose to her as his father will disinherit him unless he marries his cousin Ann Pen  by now rather cynical about love and life  toys with the idea of a marriage of convenience to Blanche and his uncle encourages him in this but  partly because he knows Harry Foker loves Blanche  Pen doesnt propose Foker leaves England for a year or two unable to marry Blanche but unwilling to marry his cousin A new character Colonel Altamont is introduced at this point he knows a secret about the Clavering family and uses it to extort money from the baronet Major Pendennis meets Colonel Altamont recognizes him from his Army service in India and knows Altamont is Lady Claverings supposedly dead first husband Mr Amory He is an escaped convict and a murderer as well Major Pendennis however doesnt act on his knowledge In addition to being blackmailed Sir Francis Clavering loses a tremendous sum of money at the races and hides from his wife and creditors in an obscure part of London Meanwhile Pen meets Fanny Bolton who is pretty and young but ignorant and lowerclass They fall in love a little but after a very short and innocent relationship Pen decides not to see her any more for the good of both Brooding and keeping to his comfortless room to avoid seeing Fanny Pen falls very ill When malicious gossip reaches Helen and Laura that Pen is entangled with a girl of low station they rush to his side they fnd Fanny in his room where she has just

with his mother Laura and Warrington who falls in love with Laura but cannot marry her because of his own catastrophic early marriage He is separated from his venal wife and her children  of whom he is only legally not biologically the father He supports them but does not see them and has no ambition because if he earns more money his wife will demand it Helens health deteriorates because of her belief in Pens immoral connection with Fanny Pen finally discovers how Helen treated Fanny he is very angry at his mother and tells her he and Fanny are innocent She is overjoyed to hear it and soon mother and son forgive each other Helens health is nevertheless too much shaken and she dies soon after Pen thus comes into possession of the family property of 500 pounds a year He leases his house at Fairoaks to tenants and returns to London while Laura goes to live as companion to a Lady Rockminster Pen does send a small amount of money to Fanny Bolton with his thanks She eventually marries a Mr Huxter who had started the gossip about her and Pen Major Pendennis still hoping to arrange a profitable marriage between Pen and Blanche Amory meets Sir Francis and threatens to divulge his secret  that he is not really married to Lady Clavering  if Sir Francis will not retire and turn over his seat in Parliament to Pen Sir Francis consents Major Pendenniss shrewd valet Morgan overhears the conversation and makes plans to extort everyone  the Major Pen Altamont Sir Francis and Lady Clavering When Morgan tries this on Major Pendennis however the Major wont stand for it as he has as much to threaten Morgan with theft as Morgan has to threaten others with At this point Pen has finally become engaged to Blanche though they do not love each other Then he learns through Morgan of the scandal concerning the Claverings Pen does what he considers the honorable thing he maintains his engagement with Blanche but refuses her family money and the seat in Parliament Now Henry Foker comes back into the picture his father has died and his fianceecousin Ann has eloped with another man leaving Harry rich and free to marry as he likes He returns to England and immediately proposes to Blanche She accepts because he is richer than Pen On learning that Blanche has broken their engagement Pen proposes to Laura whom he has come to love and is accepted because she has long loved him  even when she refused his first marriage proposal The secret of the Clavering family finally becomes known to everybody and Henry Foker breaks his engagement to Blanche  not because of her disreputable father but because she deceived him and doesnt love him There is one final surprise AltamontAmory although he IS Blanches father was bigamously married to several women before he married Blanches mother so the Clavering marriage is legal after all  but Blanche is illegitimate Blanche leaves for Paris where she apparently marries a con man Foker remains unmarried Pen and Laura marry

{"id": 6375, "text": " According to Ilan Papp the 1948 Palestinian exodus consisted of the forced relocation of close to 800000 Palestinians This was more than half of the Palestinian population at that time It also involved the destruction of 531 Palestinian villages and the emptying of 11 entire Palestinian urban neighborhoods The event is referred to by Palestinians as the Nakba the catastrophe The thesis that Papp presents is that the Nakba was a calculated and intentionally executed ethnic cleansing perpetrated by Zionist Israelis He states with emphasis that there is no room for ambivalence in this matter His references include Zionist quotations and writings military and political archives and the diaries of David BenGurion His intent is also to explore how the denial of the Nakba has been so successful for so long His views are in direct opposition to mainstream Israeli versions of the relocation which claim that the relocation was voluntary In his preface Ilan Papp says such a painful journey into the past is the only way forward if we want to create a better future for us all Papp states that the ethnic cleansing idea was first expressed in early Zionist writings For example in 1917 Leo Motzkin stated the colonization of Palestine has to go in two directions Jewish settlementand the resettlement of the Arabs In 1938 David BenGurion stated I am for compulsory transfer I do not see anything immoral in it Then in 1948 according to Ilan Papp the ethnic cleansing was implemented by David BenGurion Yigael Yadin Moshe Dayan Yigal Allon Yitzhak Sadeh Moshe Kalman Moshe Camel Yitzak Rabin Shimon Avidan Rehavam Zeevi Yitzhak Pundak and others The ideological drivers of the campaign were BenGurions close advisers whom Ilan Papp calls the Consultancy group The implementers were officers who led attacks executed by the Haganah an Israeli militia and the Irgun another Israeli militia the Stern Gang another Israeli militia and the Israeli Defense Force The details of the ethnic cleansing strategy are fully described in an Israeli militarygovernment document entitled Plan Dalet Plan Dalet according to Papp spells out in writing the clear directives of the operation It included bombarding villagessetting fire to homes properties and goods expulsion demolition and planting mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled inhabitants from returning This chapter focuses on the definition of ethnic cleansing in terms of ethics and international law and international agreements Papp refers to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights the United States Department of State and the International Criminal Court for sources of discussion He also describes the shortlived support that the US gave to the Palestinians by endorsing United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 which calls for the return of the displaced Palestinian refugees Papp states that Later on the expelled are then erased from the countrys official and popular history and excised from its collective memory He concludes that there is no denying that this alleged ethnic cleansing has been most successfully erased from conventional Israeli history Papp states in this chapter that a key ingredient in the Zionist creation of an Israeli state was such that it would be created exclusively for Jews The Muslim control of Palestine had lasted for 1300 years prior to the British Mandate Zionism emerged in the 1880s largely through the writings of Theodore Herzl The Zionist movement had been growing steadily by the time that Britain took control of Palestine after World War I On October 31 1917 the Balfour Declaration occurred Lord Balfour gave the Zionist movement his promiseto establish a national home for the Jews in Palestine Palestinians made up 8090 percent of the population of Palestine in the 1920s As a result of the Balfour Declaration Yosef Weitz began a remarkably thorough demographic study of the Palestinian villages His study is called the Village Files It was later used for key strategic information needed to implement the ethnic cleansing of Palestine This chapter also includes a history of the impact of the British military operations in suppressing the Palestinian uprisings in 1929 and in 1937 The uprising in 1937 was particularly significant in that according to Papp the British so thoroughly defeated the Palestinians that their future ability to fight for their rights to their homeland was strategically impacted Britain provided key training for the Haganah and the Irgun David BenGurion stated The Arabs will have to go BenGurions strategy for the creation of the Israeli State included very specific offensive military steps They are described in Plans A B C and D The purpose of such actions would be to deter the Palestinian population from attacking Jewish settlements and to retaliate for assaults on Jewish houses roads and traffic Plan C spelled out clearly what punitive actions would entail such as  Killing the Palestinian leadership  Killing Palestinian inciters and their financial supporters  Killing Palestinians who acted against Jews  Killing senior Palestinian officers and officials  Damaging Palestinian transportation  Damaging the sources of Palestinian livelihoods water wells mills etc Attacking nearby Palestinian villages likely to assist in future attacks  Attacking Palestinian clubs coffeehouses meeting places etc Plan Dalet Plan D called for the systematic and total expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland Here Papp recalls that in 1947 the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine called for the creation of two states and the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 181 stating so The Palestinians immediately rejected this Then David BenGurions group of close advisors that Papp calls the Consultancy began its planning to deal with the Palestinian resistance Plan D Plan Dalet was adopted on March 10 1948 It called for amongst many things the initial uprooting of 250000 Palestinians This initial uprooting represented the beginning of the actual execution of Plan Dalet Key negotiations between Israel and Jordan had led to the Jordanian promise to not join any allArab military operations against the Jewish state The agreement neutralized the strongest army in the Arab world The British departed Palestine on 15 May 1948 Haganah had 50000 trained troops The implementation of Plan Dalet continued in earnest The Deir Yassin massacre occurred In it 93 Palestinians were killed Soon after four more villages were taken They were Qalunya Saris Beit Surik and Biddu The United States offered a scheme to stop the bloodshed by first establishing a threemonth ceasefire and then developing a trusteeship plan in five years Both ideas were rejected by the Israelis BenGurion had stated Only a state with at least 80 Jews is a viable and stable state and that Palestinians can either be mass arrested or expelled it is better to expel them Papp states that many Palestinian villages such as Dayr Ayyub Beit Affa and Khisas had virtually no defense mechanism of any kind The attack on Balad alShaykh occurred leaving 60 Palestinians dead The Hawassa neighborhood in Haifa was evacuated The Sarraya house in Jaffa was bombed leaving 26 dead and the Samiramis Hotel in Qatamon was bombed leaving many others dead Papp refers to Yosef Weitz again a member of the Consultancy Weitz had stated The only solution is to transfer the Arabs from here to neighboring countries Not a single village or a single tribe must be left off In this chapter Papp describes various cities and villages and the operations to cleanse them Operation Naschon was the first operation of Plan Dalet It specifically called for the destruction of Palestinian villages in April 1948 It was the first time that the various Israeli militias would operate together as a unit and become the Israeli Defense Force Papp states the Arab governments did little beyond airing their inflammatory war rhetoric in all directions so as to hide their inaction and unwillingness to intervene on behalf of the Palestinians The United Nations plan had allocated Haifa the only port of the country to be granted Jewish control Mordechai Maklef as the operation officer of the Carmeli Brigade issued orders to Kill any Arab you encounter torch all inflammable objects and force doors open with explosives Crowds of defenseless Palestinians ran down the streets of Haifa to the port to escape on any boat they could find Many boats turned over and sank with all their passengers The next cities to fall were Acre Nazareth and Safad Papp states that the Arab Liberation Army was never a match against the well organized Israeli forces According to Papp there was never serious Arab Liberation Army strength so the falsity of the myth of a Jewish David facing an Arab Goliath was very clear As Jerusalem was cleansed British inaction was the rule In April 1948 the cleansing of Jerusalem began All in all eight Palestinian and thirty nine villages were ethnically cleansed in the Greater Jerusalem area After the battle was won by the Israeli Haganah 50000 Palestinians were forced to leave Jaffa By 15 May 1948 200 Palestinian villages were occupied and their people expelled This chapter discuses the dual nature of the 1948 conflict particularly during May 1948 On one hand there was the Arab Israeli war and on the other hand there was the ethnic cleansing In a letter that David BenGurion sent to the commanders of the Haganah brigades he stated the cleansing of Palestine remained the prime objective of Plan Dalet Papp states that the Arab war efforts were ineffective and pathetic The most intensive Arab efforts occurred in the first three weeks of the war Ethnic cleansing was conducted in at least 64 villages by the Israeli Alexandria brigade according to Papp They were also part of the massacre at Tantura per Ilan Papp on May 2 1948 He quotes from various witnesses that as many as 230 were massacred there Various other brigades such as the Golani Brigade Carmeli Brigade Kiryati Brigade Harel Brigade Bulgarian Brigade Yiftach Brigade and Givati Brigade also conducted cleansing operations Papp in this chapter discusses June through September 1948 The ethnic cleansing continued despite the passage of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights through the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 217AIII David BenGurions diary June 5 1948 states the cleansing operation continues Eliezer Kaplan the minister of finance authorized the confiscation of all Palestinian properties already taken Papp states that numerous Palestinian villages had been peacefully occupied by Muslim Druze and Christians for centuries On July 18 1948 another truce was organized by the UN mediator Count Folke Bernadotte Papp states In less than two weeks hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been expelled from their villages towns and cities Papp begins this chapter with quotes from the Badil Resource Center In 1948 85 of the Palestinians living in the areas that became the state of Israel became refugees It is estimated that there were more than 7 million Palestinian displaced persons at the beginning of 2003 He talks about Operation Hiram War Crimes During the Operation Mopping Up Operations Israels AntiReparation Policy Final Cleansing of the South and the East and The Massacre in Dawaymeh Papp states I have no illusion that it will take more than this book to reverse a reality that demonizes a people who have been colonized expelled and occupied and glorifies the very people who colonized expelled and occupied them Papp starts this chapter with another set of quotes about ethnic cleansing including Since 1967 Israel has detained 670000 Palestinians Sections of this chapter are entitled Inhuman Imprisonment Abuses Under Occupation Ghettoizing the Palestinians of Haifa Rape Dividing the Spoils Desecration of Holy Sites Entrenching the Occupation and The Land Robbery 19502000 This chapter like others starts with provocative quotes Over 700000 olive and orange trees have been destroyed by the Israelis This is an act of sheer vandalism from a state that claims to practice conservation of the environment The sections of this chapter include The Reinvention of Palestine Virtual Colonialism and the JNF The JNF Parks In Israel The Forest of Birya The Ramat Menahse Park and Greening of Jerusalem Papp states that the Israeli Land Authority the army the government and the Jewish National Fund have all been involved in establishing new Jewish settlements on the lands of the destroyed Palestinian villages He goes on to state The true mission of the JNF in other words has been to conceal these visible remnants of Palestine not only by the trees it has planted over them but also by the narratives it has created to deny their existence As an example Papp refers to the Forest of Birya which is the largest man made forest in Israel It conceals the land of six Palestinian villages Dishon AlmaIsrael Qaddita Amqa Ayn alZaytun and Biryya Also the Ramat Menashe Park covers the ruins of Lajjun Mansi Kafrayan AlButaymat Hubeza Daliyat alRawha Sabbarin Burayka AlSindiyana and Umm alZinat The Jerusalem forest is another example Here Papp states that the creation of the United Nations Relief and Work Agency was not committed to the return of the refugees as resolution 194 was There were one million Palestinian refugees and UNRWA was created to meet their daily needs as refugees He states that international peace brokers consistently sidelined the Palestinian cause and there was the categorical refusal of the Israelis to acknowledge the Nakba and their absolute unwillingness to be held accountable legally and morally for the ethnic cleansing they committed in 1948 For the following two decades there was a lull in international interest Then The June War 1967 ended with total Israeli control over all of exMandatory Palestine As a response for four decades Yassar Arafat conducted a campaign to get the world to recognize that an ethnic cleansing had occurred in 1948 And according to Papp this task for the Palestinians continues to today Papp mentions that the Knesset had even gone to the extent of passing a law that prohibited Israeli negotiators from discussing the right of return He also speculates that if Israelis were to acknowledge the Nakba that it would be akin to recognizing that they have become the mirror image of their own worst nightmare This chapter is about various measures Israel has taken to protect itself As an example Papp starts this chapter by describing a law the Knesset passed on 31 July 2003 This law states that any Palestinian who marries an Israeli will not be granted Israeli citizenship permanent residency or temporary residency He also discusses the advent of the Israeli West Bank barrier He states None of this is new because Theodore Herzl wrote in 1895 We shall endeavor to expel the poor population across the border unnoticed procuring employment for it in the transit countries but denying it any employment in our own country In 2003 Benyamin Netanyahu said If the Arabs in Israel form 40 of the population this is the end of the Jewish State But 20 is also a problem If the relationship with these 20 becomes problematic the state is entitled to employ extreme measures Here Papp states that the Faculty Club of Tel Aviv University is called the Green House It is built upon the remains of the Palestinian village Shaykh Muwannis It is the epitome of the denial of ethnic cleansing according to Papp because there is no mention of its true history Papp goes on to say furthermore that the university does not have a record of looking into the Zionist history of ethnic cleansing whatsoever in any of its disciplines He concludes by saying We end this book as we began with the bewilderment that this crime was so utterly forgotten and erased from our minds and memories But we now know the price the ideology that enabled the depopulation of half of Palestines native people in 1948 is still alive and continues to drive inexorable sometimes indiscernible cleansing of those Palestinians who live there today", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-punct", "source": "Human"}, "uid": null}

tells of JeanPaul who she had a relationship with along the course of events When reunited with Jaimy whos done recovering from an attack on sea the two decide to get married when at home in Britain When in London she reunites with friends Mairead Judy little Joannie and her grandfather Pastor Alsop her late mothers father Jacky dines with Jaimys family despite the strained relationship with Mother Fletcher She manages to charm Jaimys father and brother but his mother still hates him On the day of the wedding Mairead Judy and Joannie help get Jacky ready for the wedding but soon theres a massive interruption And its none other than British Intelligence the ones who assigned Jackys first previous mission as a spy Mairead and Judy fight the British back but Jacky is taken along with Jaimy Jacky reunites with Mr Peel and Lord Grenville When Jacky acts up Lord Grenville reminds her of past relationships with Spanish pirate Flaco Jimenez Captain Lord Richard Allen and JeanPaul de Valdon just to inform Jaimy of her cheating ways that hes already been subjected to back outside of New Orleans Soon when they come to terms that Jacky was about to embark on another mission the two officials inform Jacky of the assignment at hand Back in 1733 the ship Santa Magdalena sunk due to a dangerous typhoon and on the ship was millions upon millions of gold in coins Britain wants to retrieve that gold to help the economy and Jacky is promised a percentage of that gold and a possible pardon from the King himself despite her crimes of piracy Luckily for Jacky Jaimy is allowed to be with her on the mission but they will be on separate ships Both ships are Jackys the Dolphin and Nancy B Alsop On the Dolphin the ship will be commandeered by none other than Captain Hannibal Hudson while Jacky is to be captain of the Nancy B Jaimy is stationed on the Dolphin along with Lieutenant Flashby Despite the fact that Flashby will be in on this mission Jacky will have aboard her crew Davy and Tink from the Dread Brotherhood of the Dolphin Also on board her schooner is Higgins little Joannie Nichols and Daniel Prescott Jacky is also reunited with Dr Sebastian who is the leader of scientific expedition But as of right now Jacky dont know of anyone else who is to be helping on the expedition with the exception of her very own John Thomas and Smasher McGee What Jacky is assigned to do is sail to the Florida Keys to where the Santa Magdalena is located under the crystal blue waters of the Caribbean When allowed to leave Jacky and Jaimy are aware of their positions on separate boats Another regulation is that theres to be no sexual intercourse between the two of them the British have no use for a pregnant agent They depart on their two separate ships and sail for Boston In Spanish waters Jacky is required to take up a disguise as an American sponge diver called Jacqueline Bouvier The Spanish are conflicting with the British so Jacky and her crew must maintain an American cover when in the Caribbean Jacky prepares to revisit the Lawson Peabody School for Young Girls and wears her outrageous red wig and mantilla for the occasion When there she reunites with Annie who is married Davy and all her old Lawson Peabody friends and have dinner She sees her friend and biographer Amy Trevelyne who has recently taken a liking for Ezra Pickering Jacky reunites with Captain Hudson and Jaimy Among the others aboard for the journey are Flashby and Mr Bennett Hudson show Jacky a contraption called the diving bell which will aid Jacky underwater whilst swimming for sponges and scavenging the Santa Magdalena for the gold supply And the one designing the bell is none other than Professor Tilden himself hes the scientific expert aboard the Dolphin just as Dr Sebastian is aboard the Nancy B Alsop Before setting sail for the Keys Jacky tells Captain Hudson to be on the lookout for any shipjumpers that might get on board for information and turn it in to the opposing forces such as the Spanish Jacky and Jaimy enjoy time together but must depart for a couple of weeks While docked in Charleston Jacky Davy and Tink enjoy time together and visit a couple of taverns where she performs her songs on pennywhistle and violin The next day Jacky and the group run along a slave trade being done Black people are being auctioned to the highest bid while being laughed by a racist crowd Jacky is deeply angered by this kind of trade going on but bids for a rotund old slave woman named Jemimah Despite being laughed at by the local Colonel Ashley Tarleton for wanting an old Negro woman as a slave she takes Jemimah to the Nancy B Despite the lukewarm reception Jacky gets from her crew Jemimah is taken in as the ships cook and mother figure to Joannie and Daniel Jacky then talks to Jemimah personally to let her know she is freed as a slave and when they get to Havana she has the option to walk away with the pay she gets from Faber Shipping or stay as a permanent member of the ship Jemimah says she will decide on that later Soon Jacky is prepping on her swimming skills and gets Davy to drop his drawers and take a swim after an occasional Sunday lesson With the crew laughing at him for his fear of swimming they get Joannie to do it too much to her dismay When they get to the Keys Jacky starts swimming immediately her first dive is a dangerous one though She has a runin with what Dr Sebastian knows as a moray eel Despite Dr Sebastians interest in the creature Jacky remains terrified after being put back on board Jacky decapitated the eel and gave the carcass to Dr Sebastian Studying the coordinates of the Santa Magdalenas resting place from Carlos Maria Santana Juarezs journals from 1733 Jacky decides to explore the nearby island She notices how theres a large amount of mangroves in the area and takes Dr Sebastian Joannie and Daniel along for the trip When there Jacky puts a red sash around a mangrove bush to indicate what island it be Jemimah told the kids to collect oysters and fresh water The waters too salty as desired so they go back with no water Dr Sebastian notice fiddler crabs on the island and soon the group are ambushed by alligators It turns out the island is one big alligator pit and while they luckily escape They have to save little Joannie from one of the gators which breaks a couple of her ribs and gives her head a hard knock Once aboard they tend to her immediately and think shes not going to make it But Joannie does in the end and stays in Jackys bed for a week or so with Daniel constantly at her side Jemimah soon exposes Jacky to the chickens Higgins brought aboard while in port Jacky makes note of a fiercely territorial banty rooster that she may have use for someday Soon Jacky is ready to dive down and find the Santa Magdalena the entire crew disagrees with her all except Dr Sebastian that tells her that its he that specifically instructs her to do it Jacky dives into the water and within minutes she finds the sunken ship After such success the moment is ruined by the sight of a Spanish manofwar The boats is called the San Cristobal and it is massive in size and in ammunition The officer in charge demands who the fleet is and whats their purpose in Spanish waters Unconvinced the men scrounge the Nancy B and find no evidence to prove the crew are fakes In the mean time Jacky is hiding out in the waters and soon come up She meets the coldtempered yet dashing lieutenant and gets water on his shiny black boots The Spaniard forces Jacky to shine his shoes for her mistake and the San Cristobal sets sail towards Havana So do Jacky and the Nancy B taking in the views as heading into dock She notices Morro Castle and the heavy fortification since the assault on the city by the British In dock the lieutenant from the San Cristobal introduces himself as Juan Carlos Cisneros y Siquieros The man takes an extreme disliking towards Jacky and Jacky has mutual feelings In dock Jemimah decides to explore the town and see if she likes it enough to make her own roots Jacky Davy and Tink explore the town immersing in some cockfighting matches where Jacky trains her own banty rooster El Gringo performing at the Cafe Americano among other activities Soon Jemimah comes back to be a part of the crew but with richer more tasteful clothes from the money she received working for Faber Shipping Daniel and Joannie are happy to have their Aunt Jemimah back obviously One night at the Cafe Americano Jacky runs into old flame Flaco Jimenez and is introduced to Flacos new first mate El Feo Jacky is threatened by the presence of El Feo instantly Its a nice reunion but soon Flaco tells Jacky that he knows why shes down here in the Caribbean looking for treasure Turns out that Captain Hudson let a shipjumper on board the Dolphin and he gathered information for the Spanish and is off in the world somewhere This angers Jacky and by this time Higgins and the crew comes to pick Jacky up and carry her back to the Nancy B Spending days preparing for the cockfighting matches and immersing herself in Jemimahs Brother Rabbit and Brother Fox tales Jaimy and the Dolphin crew soon meets back up with Jacky She gives them an update on her progress and spends the night with Jaimy in her cabin The next morning on board Jacky gets ready for her first descent using the diving bell Tink makes Jacky some swim fins and she gets used to the diving bells design At first she uses the mechanism for getting some creatures for the Doctor then she ventures down to the Santa Magdalena In the meantime Flaco Jimenez and his ship is hanging around the vicinity of the wreckage uneasing the crew deeply Jacky gets underwater towards the ship with a grappling hook and uses it to pry the golden crucifix from the mainmast but still gets no access to the lower spaces of the ship Taking a break from scavenging Jacky returns back to business and eventually finds the ships vault using the hook to unhinge the door off the vault Jacky finds the gold supply of the ship In the process of getting the bell and the gold up into the ship Jacky contracts nitrogen narcosis a condition similar to alcohol intoxication that leads from high amounts of nitrogen that gets in the bloodstream Jacky dont feel anything but when the pain from the Rapture of the Deep starts to kick in she begins convulsing and shrieking until they get her back into the water to ease the condition Jaimy even though he is nervous about being in the bell under water takes her down where they makeout Dr Sebastian is angry with Jacky for getting in the condition but he takes it out on Professor Tilden who didnt tell her of the Rapture of the Deep because she was just a girl and probably wouldnt understand the science Dr Sebastian assures Tilden she is not a stupid girl and has Jacky ushered to bed The next day Jacky starts putting the gold in baskets underwater when her own greed a little Mary Faber talking in her head tells her to put fan coral in the baskets and keep the gold for herself where she can use the gold to buy another ship like her precious Emerald Jacky does it sneaking the gold into her undersea safehold for Faber Shipping Worldwide Soon Jacky encounters Flaco and his ship El Diablo Rojo and while they talk Flacos first mate El Feo plot a mutiny in secret They hold the Nancy B and its crew at gunpoint but soon a fight among the two opposing ships commences El Feo and his new ship the Red Devil sail off in retreat leaving Flaco with to side with Jacky Back in town Jacky continues with the cockfighting matches and nights at the Cafe Americano Lieutenant Cisneros corners Jacky in the club and nearly provokes a fight but Ric the owner of the cafe points out the bars etiquette rules and orders the lieutenant to leave Cisneros does but vows that its not over between the two of them As for Jaimy and the rest of the Dolphin they end up in Kingston perfectly fine They are invited to the Officers Club where it is there Jaimy runs into Captain Richard Allen Jaimy instantly remembers Allen from the time he caught Allen and Jacky skinnydipping in the Mississippi River Allen also remembers Jaimy and they have an awkward conversation Things get even more awkward when Allen runs into Flashby After another cockfighting match Jacky tells Joannie to go collect the winnings of the match But she does not return and Jacky soon figures out shes missing The crew goes all over Havana looking for the girl to little success They hear that a white man took Joannie While on the open sea Jacky runs into El Feo and his crew They are taken aboard and its found out that El Feo himself kidnapped Joannie Jacky also find out that Flashbys been working undercover for El Feo the entire mission something of a double agent El Feo demands to be shown where the gold is at and Jackys doesnt fess until Joannie and Daniel are threatened with their lives Jacky lies to El Feo saying its all on the nearby island the island full of mangroves and alligator pits El Feo has Flashby and his crew sail to the island and look for it while the rest stay aboard the Red Devil El Feo then takes Jacky to his living quarters where its there that he attempts to rape Jacky Daniel and Joannie intervene releasing El Gringo on El Feo stunning him Then Jemimah takes her huge frying pan that she bought in town and knocks him out cold Jackys crew is then able to upheave the Red Devil and throw El Feos body into the water to be with the remnants of the Santa Magdalena Finally the San Cristobal comes into view attacking both ships But the Dolphin comes to aid Jacky and the crew just in the nick of time Jacky reunites with both Jaimy and Captain Allen and fights off the Spanish warship Cisneros then comes aboard for Jacky personally vowing to kill her Fearlessly just as he is about to Jacky whips out her pistol and shoots him With the battle soon over Flaco regains his old ship and gives back the ship its original name He kisses Jacky and thanks her for the help leaving the battlefield Jaimy then soon embarks to be an officer in command on the newlynamed Saint Christopher Flaco soon comes back for his share of the gold and the gold is split evenly between the crew The Spanish sailor leaves for the southern horizon and Jacky makes her way back to Boston where her crew splits up Jemimah has federal agents search the nation for her kids that were also victims of slavery Jim Tanner reunites with Clementine Davy reunites with Annie Smasher and John go off on their own journey El Gringo retires to Dovecote and Joannie goes back to the Lawson Peabody much to her dismay Jacky returns to stay with Amy Trevelyne and Ezra Pickering and keeps her current crew Higgins Davy Tink Daniel and herself Jacky tells Ezra that she plans on buying a ship with the gold that she hid away", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-punct", "source": "Human"},

the care of Burrich Chivalrys own stableman and man at arms With Burrich Fitz travels to Buckkeep the seat of the Farseers and his arrival is preceded by his fathers abdication from the post of King in Waiting in order to protect Fitz by not allowing them to be associated through contact as well as through blood Chivalry abdicates from his position and with his wife the Lady Patience retires to the royal holdings of Withywoods before Fitz arrives Fitz never recalls that he met Chivalry but develops a bond with his fathers brother Verity Chivalry and Veritys younger halfbrother Regal despises Fitz and treats him badly when he can Burrich his fathers right hand man is left with the care and raising of the newly named FitzChivalry which he does as best he is able taking Fitz on as a stable boy Fitz quickly learns his duties and for a year or so lives with Burrich caring for the animals in the stables Fitz however is lonely and becomes a close friend of a young dog named Nosy Fitz possesses what is known as The Wit an ancient and distrusted magic which allows him to bond telepathically with animals he bonds with Nosy and the two become fast friends Burrich however discovers Fitzs bond and with apparent disgust takes Nosy away thus breaking the bond Fitz believes him to have killed the dog and afterwards is much more fearful of Burrich believing his life just as easy for Burrich to take The only other companionship Fitz finds is with children living in Buckkeep town  in particular a girl called Molly a year or two his senior Eventually Fitz agrees to become a Kings Man to King Shrewd and is bound by oath to serve the king He is taken into King Shrewds service and moves into the castle proper Here he is schooled and is taught basic combat skills by Hod the keep

during his childhood he is taught the ways of an assassin He shows great talent in his duties and is able to complete the minor tasks given to him by the king Meanwhile news comes from Withywoods of Chivalrys death  it is said that he was thrown from a horse but it is strongly suspected that Queen Desire King Shrewds second wife and Regals mother has had him assassinated As Fitz is growing up at Buckkeep the coastal regions of the Six Duchies are being attacked by Outislanders known as the RedShip Raiders The Raiders rampage through villages and towns killing and taking hostages while stealing little making their attacks seem to lack a motive The hostages are returned reduced to an animal like state with little memory of their former lives Fitz when he encounters these returned hostages finds he cannot sense them with his Wit at all This stripping away of peoples humanity is named after Forge the first village to be plundered in such a way Later on these Forged Ones become robbers and thieves that start to plunder the countryside putting another burden on the Six Duchies Fitz is eventually made part of a class of students to be taught the Skill a magic which allows its users to share thoughts and strength The teacher Galen despises Fitz while curiously revering his father it is revealed later in the book that Chivalry imprinted a false loyalty on him using the Skill in a fit of rage During the classes Galen treats Fitz without respect referring to him as Bastard Eventually he tries to kill Fitz then with more success tries to sabotage his Skill training During the last test of Galens Skill classes Galen sends Fitz to Forge ostensibly to see if he can use the Skill to get back The area is infested with Forged Ones and Fitz is attacked although he manages to return safely While he is away a stable hand in league with Galen attempts to assassinate Burrich During this event Smithy the dog Lady Patience gave Fitz and with whom Fitz is Witbonded is killed Towards the end of the book Fitz is asked to go to the neighbouring Mountain Kingdom with the objective of assassinating its prince Rurisk However this is compromised when Regal reveals Fitzs secret mission to Rurisks sister Kettricken while drunk rendering him useless He finds himself in the middle of a plan to steal the throne for Prince Regal with the help of Galen who tries to assassinate Verity using the Skill Prince Rurisk is poisoned and killed leaving Kettricken who is betrothed to Verity the sole heir of the Mountain Kingdom Fitz is poisoned and later submerged under water in a deep pool a lazy attempt by Regal to finish Fitz off When Fitz feels he only has moments to live he manages to contact Verity using the Skill to help him destroy Galen He is rescued by his dog Nosy who was not killed by Burrich but sent to the Mountain Kingdom as a gift to Prince Rurisk The rescue from the pool by Nosy left deep teeth marks in his hand that he comes to cherish as a sign of Nosys love and loyalty Nosy being an old dog by now dies  his true master Rurisk is dead and he gave his life freely remembering that we were good to one another when we were puppies in the words of Fitz Fitz is healed by Jonqui King Eyods sister afterward and the last pages of the book tell how much Fitz laments the death of Nosy during that event and the pain of an older narrator at writing this",

{"id": 6492, "text": " The story describes the adventures of Maxim Kammerer Kammerer is an amateur space explorer from Earth This occupation is not considered serious and Kammerer is regarded as a failure by his friends and relatives The novel starts when Kammerer accidentally discovers an unexplored planet Saraksh inhabited by a humanoid race The level of technological development on the planet is similar to mid20th century Earth Recently the planet had a nuclear and conventional war and the predicament of the population is dire When Kammerer lands the natives mistake his spaceship for a weapon and destroy it At first Kammerer does not take his situation seriously He imagines himself a Robinson Crusoe stranded on an island inhabited by primitive but friendly natives He is looking forward to establishing contact and befriending the population of the planet However the reality turns out to be far from glamorous Kammerer finds himself in the capital of a totalitarian state perpetually at war with its neighbors The population is governed by the oligarchy of Unknown Fathers through brutal police and military repression The city is grim and polluted Ordinary populace leads the life of privation and misery What goes on around Kammerer does not make sense to him since his own society is free from war crime and material shortages Eventually it is revealed that to maintain the loyalty of the population the Fathers employ mind control broadcasts The broadcast towers pepper the landscape of the country The mindaltering capabilities of the towers are kept secret they are disguised as ballistic missile defense installations Constant broadcasts suppress the ability to evaluate information critically hence making the omnipresent regime propaganda much more effective In addition twice a day intense broadcasts relieve mental stress caused by the disconnect between the propaganda and the observed reality by inducing an outburst of blinding enthusiasm The authors give a masterful description of this process at work describing the thoughts of one of the characters as he switches from the state of peeved boredom and disdain for his superiors to the rapturous adoration of people around him and life in general A minority of the population are not susceptible to the broadcasts In these people the intense daily broadcasts induce horrible headache and seizures The Unknown Fathers  the ruling oligarchs are in this minority They pay for the power to control the people by intense personal suffering during the daily broadcasts The people outside the power elite that are not susceptible to the broadcasts are branded degenerates or degens by the state They are actively persecuted When captured they are either executed or sent to prison The renegade degens organized an underground resistance movement and try to fight back by destroying the broadcast towers The resistance does not have any political or military program and the fighters are united mostly by their suffering and their hatred of the towers However the rankandfile of the underground is unaware of the main purpose of the towers Apparently the underground leadership wants to capture the broadcast network and use it to seize the power in the state for themselves Kammerer still not quite aware of the situation gets enlisted in the military He is required to execute captured degens one of them a woman When he refuses he is shot Kammerer survives joins the underground and participates in a futile attack on a broadcast tower Captured tried and sent to a concentration camp in the South the same one where he made his landing hes finally revealed the truth about the broadcast system by a fellow prisoner member of underground Astonished and appalled by the revelation Kammerer makes it his mission to rid the planet of the mind control broadcast system Several of his schemes fail because the cure may be worse than the disease He tries to organize an invasion by barbarian tribes from the inhospitable desert in the South He then tries to contact the states neighbor  the Island Empire He abandons this plan after finding documents on a destroyed Empire submarine that describe mass killings and other atrocities that the Empire military perpetrates He now focuses on trying to find and destroy the Control Center where the mind control broadcasts originate Kammerer gets captured and is consigned to a penal battalion that is supposed to lead the invasion of the North In this abortive action most of his friends perish while Kammerer himself barely escapes annihilation in retaliatory nuclear blasts It turns out that Kammerer is not affected by the broadcasts in any way A Father known as Smart realizes that and plots to use Kammerer to stage a coup and take over the power in the state His plan is for Kammerer to capture the Control Center and use the mind control broadcasts to incapacitate the rivals and control the population The Center is protected by intense local broadcasts that make it impossible for anyone but Kammerer to penetrate it Initially Kammerer plays along However after gaining access to the Center instead of using it to gain power Kammerer destroys it In the end of the novel it is revealed that one of the Fathers  Strannik literally Wanderer  is a human progressor Rudolf Sikorski Strannik was carefully preparing the operation to gradually improve the lot of the people of Saraksh His plan was ruined by Kammerers actions Strannik catches Kammerer and lambastes him for his interference Strannik describes the unanticipated consequences of Kammerers rash actions up to 20 of the people may die due to the withdrawal of the mind control transmissions on which they have become dependent Saraksh faces famine anarchy and invasion from the North Strannik tells Kammerer to leave the planet However Kammerer refuses and stays to help Strannik stabilize the situation Despite the upheavals that Saraksh has to go through Kammerer is still glad he destroyed the Control Center because now the people are in charge of their own destiny", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-punct", "source": "Human"},

magical devices of their own As a token that they are all equals Melius chooses a sword imbued with the skills of six master swordsmen The sword grants the wielder sword mastery Moving the focus of the novel to Conan it describes how the city of Belverus in Nemedia is unsafe the tariffs exorbitantly high starvation rampant sedition brewing and that King Garian seems ineffective as a ruler In reality Albanus is busy funding and controlling all the unrest in Nemedia as a means of focusing hatred on King Garian Conan is attacked in Belverus by Melius who it later turns out was driven insane and possessed in a fashion by the tortured spirits in the magical sword he was given by Albanus Albanus did not know that the blade could cause such madness Conan is rescued by the town guard who find to their horror that they have just slain a noble Conan picks up the blade and wraps it with the hopes of selling it for a few pieces of silver Shortly thereafter Conan meets up with Hordo a friend of

a smuggler fetches a high bounty Hordo decides to quit his job and join Conan in his mercenary venture Hordo is often used as a foil to Conan contrasting the intelligence of Conan to Hordos less sophisticated thought process and abilities of perception The pair go to a tavern where Conans fortune is divinated by an old man The same fortune appears on the first page of the first mass market printing The first part of the prophecy comes true as Conan thwarts an attempt by a lady patron of the tavern from pick pocketing him Leaving the tavern Conan and Hordo noticed they are being followed

recover the magic sword and cover up all traces of it Upon returning to the Thestis Conan sells the magic sword of Melius to Demetrio an agent of Albanus for fifty gold marks Conan uses the money from the sword to found his own freecompany of mercenaries and teaches them horse archer techniques unknown to the Nemedian forces The next time Conan returns to the Thestis Conan receives a message that he should meet Hordo at the Sign of the Full Moon The Thestians are worried that they may be betrayed but Conan allays these fears by vowing to never betray them At the Sign of the Full Moon Conan is ambushed and attacked by assassins He is also pursued by the Belverus town guard who have also been paid off by Albanus The message was fake The next day Ariane sets up a meeting for Conan with Taras to see if Conan can be hired for the uprising It turns out Taras is not hiring mercenaries and intends to kill Conan as per Albanuss request The attempt is thwarted and the ambushers are all killed by Conan Ariane having followed Conan sees the butchery and believes that Conan has betrayed them The horse archer skills get Conans company a job in the Nemedian military and Conan a room within the

goes to find Stephano at Albanuss mansion but is captured and hypnotized by Albanus Vegentius ambushes Conan in the halls of the palace and frames him as a traitor King Garian decides that the Ancient Punishment would be the best in the case of a turncoat Meanwhile Albanus uses magic on the clay sculpture of Garian and animates it so as to be a simalcrum of Garian Albanus kills Stephano The plan is The simalcrum takes over the place of the real Garian Albanus sends the signal for the unknowing Thestians to rise up and rebel and the simalcrum hands over power to Albanus to appease the rebels Conan learns that King Garian has been replaced when Albanus and the simalcrum come to gloat over Conan in the dungeons of the palace Conan learns this because the simalcrum does not have the bruises that Conan gave the real Garian while they were sparring As Conan is imprisoned the people rise up at the behest of the hypnotized Ariane Conan is sent to the arena of Belverus to be devoured by the wolves as the ancient punishment dictates Conan thwarts the wolves by rushing into them as they are released and smashing through them and out the stillopen gate through which the wolves were released

Minnick arrives to recover the stolen child Cynthia tries to bribe his colleague Mrs Sheridan but to no avail as she believes Nestas influence has spoiled the boy After they have gone Nesta reveals to Cynthia Ogdens past as the Little Nugget and the repeated attempts to kidnap him made by US gangsters Nesta wishes to call in professional help but Cynthia persuades her she can still do it with the help of her new fianc a wealthy man called Peter Burns who she suggests can take up a post at Ogdens new school posing as a trainee schoolmaster We meet Peter Burns and learn that he fell deeply in love sometime between the ages of 21 and 25 with a Miss Audrey Blake daughter of an impoverished artist Though he treated her in a patronizing way they got engaged but shortly after the death of her father she ran off and married another man This event crushed Burns once a carefree and selfish youth and after some years of travel he returned to London chastened and became engaged to Cynthia Drassilis mostly out of sympathy for her plight When she visits him the day after his proposal she easily talks him into helping her out in her scheme He meets school head Mr Abney and is soon signed up as Classics master at Sanstead House the school to which Mr Ford plans to send Ogden At Sanstead Burns takes up his duties and soon finds his feet with the boys he also befriends White the smoothmannered butler Ogden Ford arrives a few days later and a rather shocked Abney requests that Burns discourage his rudeness and smoking Burns quickly learns that any attempt to kidnap the tempestuous boy will require great skill Time passes and Ford introduces numerous vices to the school In the local inn one day Burns sees a suspiciouslooking American later he sees White the butler chasing someone away from the school with a pistol White explains that he is a detective from the Pinkerton agency hired by Mr Ford to watch over his son The following day another American visits the school a pleasant man claiming to be a friend of Mr Ford who soon leaves again having toured the place The next evening Burns is strolling outside when he hears Ogden scream and a man runs into him knocking him down An excited crowd gathers to discuss the incident a man found breaking into Ogdens room when Mrs Sheridan appears for an appointment with Abeny Burns quickly sees that she is in fact his former fiance Audrey Things are awkward between them at first but they soon make up Burns meets the American from the village who turns out to be Buck MacGinnis former kidnapper of Ogden and who thinks Burns is none other than his rival Smooth Sam Fisher Burns questions White about these men and learns that while Buck a common hoodlum Fisher is an educated and dangerously smooth man Spending more time with Audrey he realises his love for her is still strong One day MacGinnis and his gang raid the school holding up the masters at gunpoint MacGinnis takes Burns to search for Ogden but Burns flees out of the study window As he is climbing out MacGinnis shoots him but he makes it to the cover of some bushes Burns tackles MacGinnis breaking his leg and the gang flees without the missing Ogden Burns frees the rest of the school and the police are called Ogden still cannot be found and a friend is also found to be missing Burns volunteers to go to London to search for the runaways and Audrey implores him to search well saying she will lose her job with Mr Ford if Ogden is not found We learn that Burns has bribed Ogden to go to London and arranged to have his valet send the boy to his mother Nesta Ford Abney the headmaster sick in bed with a cold learns that the butler is a detective and sends him on the trip to London with Burns On the way White reveals that he saw Burns give Ogden his directions and also that he is in fact none other than Smooth Sam Fisher proposing to come in with Burns on the presumed kidnapping job Burns flees to his flat but learns that Ogden has not arrived there Fisher arrives having followed Burns but on learning Ogden is off enjoying London he leaves to seek him After a days search Burns finds the boy at the house of his friends mother and brings him back to the school Fisher also returns threatening to expose Burns actions if his identity is revealed Ogden is moved to a safe room and guarded Burns relationship with Audrey chills after he is reminded he is engaged and he foils another attempt by Fisher to take the boy The school term ends but Mr Ford cannot collet Ogden for a few days so Abney asks Burns to join Audrey and the

and he sees MacGinnis is also back in the neighbourhood He drives Fisher out of the house and takes guard himself still without Audreys faith Fisher comes back having joined up with MacGinnis and offers Burns a last chance which he rejects With the phone wires cut Burns tries to sneak Ogden across country but they are trapped in the loft of the school stables Ogden bored of the chase surrenders himself and Audrey breaks down in tears comforted by Burns Some days later Burns and Audrey speak of their love but she insists he stand by his promise to Cynthia They part and Cynthias
