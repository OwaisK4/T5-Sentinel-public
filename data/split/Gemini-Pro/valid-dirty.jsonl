One occurred in the first half, involving Mark Cueto, and was due to an offside ruling. The other happened in the final moments of the match, but the referee did not use television replays. Robinson said he was incredibly angry and felt his team was denied two tries. He questioned why technology wasn't used. Jonathan Kaplan, the referee, thought Cueto was in front of Charlie Hodgson when Hodgson kicked the ball across the field. Kaplan also chose not to speak with the fourth official when Josh Lewsey appeared to score what could have been the winning try. Robinson stated that Cueto's try was legitimate and the referee should have checked the video for Lewsey's try. He emphasized that the technology exists to be used. Robinson said he was confused about the Cueto try and thought both attempts looked like successful tries. He expressed disappointment and acknowledged the hurt the loss would cause. He added that while they were upset, the referee's decision was final. Robinson believed his team did everything possible to win. He said he was proud of his players and thought a couple of different decisions could have led to a significant victory. He felt they were the dominant team.

President Askar Akaev promoted the law to use the ink in the upcoming elections to live up to the country's prior reputation as a democratic place. The United States government agreed to pay for all the related costs.\n\nMany see the nation as declining from a high point in the 1990s, citing a rushed referendum in 2003 that reduced the legislature to a single body. The ink is part of a wider movement to show commitment to fair elections, with other contributions, such as clear ballot boxes, coming from external governments and organizations along with the Kyrgyz government.\n\nThe ink technology is simple. The ink is applied to a voter's left thumb, dries, and cannot be seen in normal light.\n\nUnder ultraviolet light, the ink glows neon yellow. Before voting, an election worker will check the voter's thumb with a UV lamp, and every voter will have their left thumb sprayed before getting a ballot. If ink is visible under the light, the voter is not allowed to vote, and any voter who refuses the ink will not get a ballot. These elections are more important because the upcoming parliamentary elections precede a possible change in the Autumn presidential election, and resemble recent elections in other countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union. The ink's use has caused controversy, particularly among groups seen as pro-government.\n\nSome published articles compared the ink to a practice of marking sheep.\n\nOne author started a petition against the ink. Much of the opposition is based on misinformation, with stories in local papers claiming the ink is harmful, radioactive, or that the UV readers cause health problems. Other organizations support the move. This ink is used in elections in many countries, and another common ink type has caused problems in the past. The \"invisible\" ink has its own issues, often creating rumors.\n\nIn one country, religious leaders had to reassure people the ink's use wasn't against their religion.

{"id": 6754, "text": "Employing broadcast MIMO in cellular downlink networks boosts data speeds but necessitates channel information from mobile devices via the uplink. This introduces a dynamic where uplink resources can be allocated to enhance downlink performance. This study examines the relationship between uplink feedback and downlink rates, evaluating finite and infinite network scenarios. Results indicate that at sufficient signal-to-noise ratios, sacrificing uplink resources for feedback yields a net positive gain in downlink speed. This gain improves with longer channel coherence times and diminishes with a greater number of base stations being monitored. Furthermore, dedicating a fixed proportion of uplink resources to channel information enables progressive enhancement of downlink multiplexing in bounded networks. Conversely, in boundless networks, achievable rate scaling with signal-to-noise ratio is limited to a doubly logarithmic relationship. These findings demonstrate that adjusting feedback levels offers control over the equilibrium between uplink and downlink rates, a crucial feature for operators addressing fluctuating user requirements in contemporary cellular systems.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Also, current multi-scale approaches insufficiently gather diverse features for segmenting small objects, focusing only on varied size perspectives.

{"id": 6757, "text": "The story continues directly from the previous installment. A Spackle army approaches New Prentisstown from one direction, while the Answer's forces advance from the opposite direction. Todd has freed Mayor Prentiss to aid in the town's defense, while Viola seeks assistance with the Answer and the scout ship. The Mayor organizes his army and launches attacks on the Spackle army at the waterfall near the town. Though outmatched in weaponry, the Spackle possess overwhelming numbers and have upgraded their arsenal since the previous war. Their weaponry includes bows and arrows, as well as a new weapon that shoots white 'sticky' fire mounted on bullock-like creatures called \u2018battlemores\u2019. In addition, they possess white sticks that fire a mixture of organic chemicals. Todd nearly succumbs to the fire weapon, but he uses his Noise to disable the battlemore rider. A second wave of soldiers, supported by artillery, forces the Spackle into retreat. Viola locates Mistress Coyle with the scout ship at the demolished communications tower. Simone and Bradley, two friends from the settler convoy, find Viola and are shocked by the condition of her and the settlement. Mistress Coyle attempts to justify her actions, but Viola silences her and advises Simone and Bradley not to trust the healer. Concerned for Todd's safety, Viola asks Bradley to launch a survey probe. After witnessing the war and Spackle weaponry, Viola nearly launches a point-to-point missile at the battle to save Todd. However, the Mayor\u2019s secret artillery fires first. Simone and Bradley agree with Viola's decision not to trust anyone except Todd and send the probe to observe the Spackle encampment, revealing their vast numbers. The narrative then shifts to a Spackle, 1017, called the Return, who exists separately from the Land, the Spackles. He seeks revenge on the Clearing for killing his \u2018one\u2019. His perspective concludes with the probe being shot down. The next day, the Spackle dam the river, cutting off the water supply, and attack the Mayor's camp with burning boomerangs. Coyle tries to manipulate Viola into launching a missile to save Todd, but Bradley strongly opposes it. Todd becomes an easy target when his horse, Angharrad, refuses to move and he refuses to abandon her. When Viola mistakenly believes Todd has been hit by a boomerang, she launches the missile, resulting in a massive explosion. This kills all the Spackle archers and divides the two armies. The Mayor sends the thought \u2018I am the circle and the circle is me\u2019 into Todd, who resists at first but then embraces it as it quietens his Noise and provides comfort and power. Viola arrives in the town square, shaken by her role in the war. Todd claims he would have done the same for her, but she finds little solace. She notices Todd's quieter Noise, and he sees that she is ill, but neither elaborates on their conditions. The narrative shifts again to the Return, who argues with the Sky, the leader of the Spackle, demanding more attacks. The Sky refuses to act against the good of the Land but offers the Return 'the Source' - a human captured before the war. The Sky promises the Source to the Return if peace is achieved. The Return is unsure why such a person would be considered a reward until he recognizes the Source as Ben, Todd's adoptive father. Refugees arrive from the outskirts of New Prentisstown, with men joining the Mayor's forces and women joining Coyle's. The Spackle launch random attacks on the town, targeting and killing scouts. The white sticks are revealed to be ballistic weapons that shoot acid. Eventually, the water store is attacked, and nearly all of the remaining water is lost. The Mayor loses control of his Noise and Todd takes command. Todd regrets controlling James, a soldier who died in the flood, and feels responsible for his death. Now without water and the Answer without food, the two groups meet for peace talks at the ruined House of Healing. Todd and Viola reveal the presence of hidden soldiers but conceal Todd's weakening Noise and Viola's worsening infection. An exchange of food takes place. The Mayor lures Spackle out to fight, and the Answer provides bombs, enraging Bradley, who convinces Todd and Viola to stop. A Spackle is captured and sent back with two messages, one of silence from the Mayor and one of peace from Todd. He hears the Spackle call him \u2018the Knife\u2019 before running away. Angered by the Mayor's undermining of her, Mistress Coyle sends a bomb into the Spackle stronghold. The Spackle respond by sending the same captured Spackle, requesting a meeting with the Sky on the hill. Viola and Bradley, who has caught the Noise germ, are sent to negotiate. The Sky greets them, but the Return recognizes Viola as Todd's \u2018one\u2019 and attempts to kill her. He stops upon seeing the ID band, and is taken away by the Land. The peace talks hesitantly resume. That night, the Spackle launch a surprise attack on the Mayor and Todd. But the Mayor, having read the Sky's Noise, anticipates the attack and sets up his defenses. After repelling the attack, the Mayor tells the Sky that he can read him and that he should forfeit. The Sky, shocked, agrees. The Return goes to Pathway\u2019s End to kill Ben, but the Sky intervenes and watches as the Return fails, unable to kill. He wakes Ben, who can now speak the Land's language. The next day, peace is achieved, with negotiations ongoing. The Mayor strategically announces that they have secured the hilltop and that a cure for the ID band infection has been found. Mistress Coyle denounces the Mayor and tests the cure. Testing reveals that the cure uses an aggressive antibiotic mixed with aloe. Todd decides whether Viola should take the cure. The Mayor teaches Todd how to read by using his Noise. After reading his mother\u2019s diary, Todd asks the Mayor if the cure is real, and the Mayor replies ambiguously. Convinced, Todd brings Viola the bandages to treat her infection. Mistress Coyle announces her resignation, but it turns out to be a plot to kill the Mayor with a bomb. Todd saves the Mayor instead of Simone, revealing his ability to control people with his Noise. Horrified by this subconscious act, Viola tells Todd she can no longer trust him, causing his Noise to flare up. The Mayor interrupts, intending to deliver another speech to reassure the citizens. As the Mayor begins, Ben and the Return arrive. Todd embraces Ben, leaving the Mayor feeling betrayed. Ben now prefers to communicate with Noise, and Todd's Noise opens up around him. Todd asks Viola to leave New Prentisstown with him after the war, declaring that he doesn\u2019t care about what will happen to everyone else. He apologizes for expressing his feelings, but Viola kisses him. The party splits to settle a peace immediately, leaving Todd and the Mayor alone. Angered that Todd no longer cares about him, the Mayor shoots Ivan, steals the scout ship, and kidnaps Todd. Learning how to operate the ship by stealing Bradley\u2019s Noise, the Mayor launches missiles at the Spackle, where Bradley, Viola, and Ben are negotiating. The missiles do not explode. The Mayor remixes the fuel and releases it, creating a fire that kills many Spackles, including the Sky. The Return becomes the new Sky. Todd manages to convey that they are headed for the ocean, but is cut off by the Mayor. The new Sky releases the water. The town is swept away, and the army returns to self-control. Humans and the Sky agree on a ceasefire. The Mayor lands at the ocean. The new Sky decides to attack the settlers, while the Mayor orders his captains to attack the Answer and march into the town square to die. Lee, using a rifle with Wilf's help, kills Captain Tate and the soldiers join the remaining people. Wilf and Ben dissuade the Sky from the attack. Viola and Bradley ride to the ocean to help Todd. However, Viola's horse dies, and she is forced to ride Angharrad while Bradley is left behind. At the ocean, the Mayor congratulates Todd, then says he will be a fine leader of New World. The Mayor then fights with Todd, using only their noises, and Todd wins. The Mayor then commits suicide by walking into the sea. The Sky arrives with Ben. He mistakes Todd for the Mayor and shoots him in the chest with the acid rifle. Todd dies, driving Viola to threaten shooting the Sky back. The Sky realises how wrong he was to do so, and feels the regret Todd felt when killing a Spackle in book one. Viola stops short of killing him, realising that it would cause never-ending war, and that no one would remember Todd. She returns to Todd. Ben says he can hear Todd\u2019s Noise. The Spackle attempt to cure Todd with their medicine and house him in the Pathway\u2019s End. The remedies are working, and his Noise returns in burst on and off. The main convoy is about to arrive to a large ceremony, one which Viola will not attend because she will not leave Todd\u2019s side until he wakes up, though she knows that he will be changed, like Ben was. The Sky has promised not to take the cure for the band infection until Todd is cured, in an act of self-discipline, but Viola does not forgive him and will not let him enter to see Todd. Everyday, Viola continues to read Todd's mother's journal to him, hoping that he will hear and come back. He is entering his old memories, at his school, at Farbranch, but also human and Spackle memories from all over New World. He searches for Viola, unsure who she is, who he is. Every now and then, he hears abstracts from his mother\u2019s diary, and Viola, and he begs Viola to keep calling for him.

These individuals, Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar, and Feroz Abbasi, have been detained by the US for approximately three years at the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror.\" Straw stated that the US had agreed to their release following extensive and complex discussions about security, and that the government had been negotiating their return since 2003. The families of all four men have been informed of their return and have been in regular discussions with the government, according to Straw.\n\nHe also mentioned that upon their return to the UK, the police would consider arresting them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning related to possible terrorist activity. Michael Ancram, the shadow foreign secretary, expressed his approval of the return of the four detainees but raised serious questions about the potential threat they pose to the UK and the treatment they received while detained. Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, stated that the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\" and that their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\n\nAzmat Begg, Moazzam's father, thanked his lawyers and the British people for their support in campaigning for his son's release, adding that if they have done something wrong, they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there. Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Abbasi and Mubanga, criticized the government for not acting sooner, stating that they should have made it clear to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. Roger Godsiff, Moazzam Begg's Labour MP, welcomed his release but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said detainees get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money and he did not see any difference in this case.\n\nHuman rights campaigners have expressed outrage at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba, with Amnesty International calling Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness,\" and both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue.\" Liberty, a civil rights group, expressed its delight but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial. Director Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. The Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws, but they are still behind bars.\n\nThe US also announced that Mamdouh Habib, a 48-year-old Australian previously accused of terrorist offenses, would be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March of the previous year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6778, "text": "The technology and artistic communities have long collaborated informally, offering assistance in both technical and creative realms. This support often took the form of corporate sponsorship of the arts or the provision of technological infrastructure. However, these interactions are becoming more integrated, as technology companies seek inspiration from the creative sectors and vice versa. British Telecom (BT) is committed to this concept and has initiated the Connected World program, aiming to develop a \"21st-century model\" to unite the art, technology, and business sectors. According to BT, the initiative is designed to gain insights into the creative industry's inherent need for broadband technology. Frank Stone, the head of BT's business sector programs, oversees several \"centers of excellence\" established by the telco with external entities, one of which focuses on creative industries.\n\nTo inaugurate the initiative, a major international art installation is scheduled to open in Brussels on April 15, followed by another exhibit in Madrid later in the summer. These installations utilize BT's internally developed technology, including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. Artists Langlands & Bell, winners of a Bafta award, have employed a 3D graphics engine, similar to those used in gaming, to construct a virtual, narrative-based, 3D model of Brussels' Coudenberg Cellars.\n\nThese cellars, recently excavated, are believed to be remnants of Coudenberg Palace, a historic center of European power. The 3D environment can be navigated with a joystick, providing an immersive experience of a landscape that once featured a river, which was subsequently enclosed in the 19th century. The artists stated that the river was vital to the city's existence for centuries, and its disappearance was also essential to the city. They hope that by revealing the river, they can enhance the understanding of the connections between the past and the present, and appreciate the flow of modernity, which once concealed but now reveals the River Senne. Their earlier projects incorporated the Quake game graphics engine. A game engine is a core component of video games that manages graphics rendering, game AI, and object behavior and relationships. These engines are costly and time-consuming to create and are often licensed for use in other graphics-intensive games. BT's own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture), has been in development since 2001 and has been used to create virtual interactive models of buildings for urban planners. It was also used in 2003 in Encounter, a pervasive urban game that combined virtual play with real-world action. To accommodate the artists' desire for video and interactive elements, new features were added to Tara to process complex datasets. However, collaborations between art and digital technology are not new, and many coders, designers, game developers, and animators consider their creations to be art.\n\nAs more tools for self-expression become available to the public, such as the ability to take photos with phones and upload them to the internet, creativity will become an essential part of technology. The Orange Expressionist exhibition from the previous year showcased thousands of picture messages from people across the UK, creating an interactive installation.\n\nTechnology has significant potential as a means of unleashing creativity, particularly by providing people with ways to use their technology. Large businesses recognize the benefits of engaging with the creative sector. Mr. Stone described the art world as \"fantastically rich,\" filled with creative individuals and ideas, which attracts traditional companies like BT. Between 1997 and 2002, the creative industry contributed \u00a321 billion to London alone, and it continues to grow by 6% annually. The partnership between artists and technologists is part of an effort to understand the creative potential of technologies such as broadband internet, according to Mr. Stone. He stated that this is not just about putting art galleries and museums online, but about ensuring that everyone has the best possible experience and exploring the role of technology in achieving this. With broadband penetration reaching 100% in the UK, companies with a stake in the technology seek to provide people with reasons to want and use it. The creative drive is not entirely altruistic, but about both industries sharing strategies and creative ideas, potentially leading to improved business practices for creative industries or more patentable ideas for tech companies. Mr. Stone described the strategy as \"outside-in thinking,\" with the goal of creating a future cultural drive for the economy.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 6779, "text": "Breast cancer, as indicated by the World Health Organization, is the cancer most frequently found in women. It is the second most prominent cause of death in women globally, eventually becoming the most deadly cancer. Mammogram image segmentation is essential for image analysis and diagnosis, especially regarding the analysis of the shapes and boundaries of mammary lesions. Nevertheless, segmenting mammograms is challenging, due to its great dependence on the mammary tissues present. This paper introduces a new, semi-supervised segmentation algorithm that adapts the GrowCut algorithm for automated mammogram segmentation after a specialist selects an area of interest. The suggested method utilizes fuzzy Gaussian membership functions to alter the evolution rule of the original GrowCut algorithm, thereby approximating the uncertainty of a pixel being either object or background. The approach's primary benefit is that it greatly reduces the expert's workload in initializing GrowCut's seed points for precise segmentation, because it eliminates the need to select background seeds. Also, a point selection process based on simulated annealing optimization was developed to avoid human involvement. The proposed method was qualitatively compared with other current segmentation techniques, while considering the shape of segmented areas. The approach was validated by constructing an image classifier using a standard multilayer perceptron. Zernike moments were used to extract segmented image features. This analysis involved 685 mammograms from the IRMA breast cancer database, employing fat and fibroid tissues. The results showed that the suggested technique achieved a classification rate of 91.28\\% for fat tissues, illustrating its potential.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This paper presents a new integrated importance sampling (iIS) approach to estimate LOOCV predictive p-values using Markov chain samples from a complete dataset. iIS works by integrating out latent variables of the test observation using its conditional distribution, without considering the actual observation. Importance sampling theory confirms that iIS produces results equivalent to LOOCV predictive p-values. The paper compares iIS with three other existing methods using two disease mapping datasets. The findings demonstrate that iIS estimates predictive p-values almost identically to actual LOOCV and more accurately than the posterior predictive checking, ordinary importance sampling, and the ghosting method by Marshall and Spiegelhalter (2003).", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Leo flew the Argo II, and Annabeth distracted Gleeson Hedge with mixed martial arts reruns. Jason dressed in a toga over his Camp Half-Blood shirt, and Piper practiced her landing dialogue. Annabeth, still wary of Jason, considered the possibility of a trap. She thought about how much she missed Percy whenever she looked at Jason and felt a strange chill. Annabeth couldn't pray to Athena due to a recent, unpleasant encounter where her mother gave her a terrible gift. Camp Jupiter's horns announced the Argo II's arrival. Annabeth was amazed by the size of the camp, twice that of Camp Half Blood, and recognized landmarks Jason had described. She noticed signs of recent battles, including damage to the Senate House. An explosion occurred, and Terminus appeared on the Argo II, forbidding weapons past the Pomerian Line and criticizing Jason for associating with Greeks. Piper attempted to charmspeak Terminus, who rejected her. Terminus threatened to destroy the ship, angering Leo. Annabeth tried to calm the situation, but Terminus was offended by her being Athena's daughter. Before Annabeth could question Terminus, Jason requested permission to land. Annabeth saw Percy with Frank and Hazel and knew she needed to reach him. Recognizing Percy as Praetor, Annabeth instructed Leo to halt the ship. She inquired about a rule against hovering above New Rome. Upon learning there wasn't one, Annabeth proposed keeping the Argo II airborne and using a rope ladder, with all weapons remaining on board, provided the legion followed suit. Terminus agreed, and Annabeth reunited with Percy, kissing him before judo-flipping him and extracting a promise that he would never leave her again, which Percy reciprocated. Later, Annabeth and Reyna were attacked by the Argo II while walking on a hill, leading them to discover that Percy, Jason, Piper, Frank, and Hazel were under attack by Romans due to the ship's actions.

They tricked Narcissus and escaped with the bronze with the help of Arion, Hazel's horse, and Echo, who stayed to try to save Narcissus again. The group made a stop in Kansas, based on a vision Piper had, where they found Bacchus, the Roman equivalent of Mr. D. This turned out to be a trap set by Gaea, who forced Percy and Jason to battle while possessed by eidolons. Piper managed to stop them, and Blackjack carried the unconscious heroes back to the ship. The group realized that the earlier chills Annabeth and Leo had experienced were caused by the eidolons. After realizing that three eidolens are residing in Percy, Jason and Leo, Piper expelled the eidolons, making them swear never to return to the ship or its crew. The seven then headed to Atlanta. Percy dreamed of the giants Ephialtes and Otis and realized they had trapped Nico di Angelo in a jar, sustained by Persephone's pomegranate seeds which induced a death-like trance, thus fulfilling Ella's prophecy. They had five days to rescue him before Rome fell on July 1st. Annabeth woke Percy, kissed him, and took him to her favorite part of the ship. Percy shared his dream, and Annabeth held him close, letting him sleep. Frank found him the next day, creating an awkward situation.

The ship sailed across the Atlantic. Hazel shared a vision from her past with Leo, revealing Sammy Valdez saving her from a bully and acquiring a diamond. Sammy, who kept the diamond, was Leo's great-grandfather. In the vision, Sammy, cuddling baby Leo, spoke of a vision from Hera and told baby Leo to apologize to Hazel. Sammy, who thought Hazel had disappeared, sold the diamond and believed himself cursed. As Hazel and Leo awakened from their sharing, Hazel was crying, and Leo introduced himself to her, with Hazel crying. Then a monster attacked the ship. Frank fell overboard while Leo and Hazel fell into the ocean. They were saved by Chiron's brothers, Aphros and Bythos. After they release the trio back to the ship, they sent a force to deal with Phorcys and Keto. The voyage continued to Rome, through the entrance to the Mediterranean, where they were tested by Hercules. Piper cut off Achelous's horn, which became a cornucopia, and they tricked Hercules. They were boarded by pirates led by Medusa's son, but they escaped and made an offering to Bacchus. Once in Rome, Annabeth had lunch with Percy, said goodbye, and left with Rhea Silvia to follow The Mark of Athena. Percy, Piper, and Jason were nearly drowned by vengeful water nymphs but managed to rescue Nico Di Angelo. Bacchus aided them against a giant due to the offering. After retrieving the Athena Parthenos, the floor cracked, and Annabeth fell into a pit. Percy caught her, but Arachne pulled her down with a line of webbing. Percy, unable to hold on, released his grip, promising never to leave Annabeth. Holding hands, they fell into Tartarus. Back on the Argo II, the remaining six demigods agreed to head to Greece to the House of Hades and shut them from that side, while Percy and Annabeth travel through Tartarus to reach the other side of the Doors there. Leo told Festus to prepare the ship to set sail for their friends.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

To further decrease computational requirements while maintaining accuracy, specific pixels are chosen from user-provided markings. The method's performance is assessed using both human and automated annotations to guide the division of images into foreground and background. A new, unbiased set of image datasets with annotations was created to provide a standard evaluation for scribble-based segmentation techniques.

Convolutional networks are better at predicting tumor volume than typical math models, suggesting deep learning is promising. Current 2D methods don't fully use the tumor's 4D imaging data over time, and they mainly predict volume, not other relevant tumor characteristics. This work uses convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) to represent tumor growth, extracting image features and tracking changes over time in one network. ConvLSTM is expanded to the spatio-temporal domain (ST-ConvLSTM) to learn 3D relationships between slices and temporal changes from patient data. The approach can include non-imaging patient data and be trained completely end-to-end. Testing on a large 4D tumor dataset of 33 patients shows that ST-ConvLSTM has a Dice score of 83.2%+-5.1% and RVD of 11.2%+-10.8%, better than linear, ConvLSTM, and generative adversarial network (GAN) methods (p<0.05) in predicting future tumor volumes. Also, this new method predicts cell density and CT intensity.

A story depicts a research station on Jupiter's surface, a cold and dangerous place where scientists transform into beings that can survive there. A scientist transforms himself and his dog, Towser, who then experiences Jupiter as paradise and communicates telepathically with his master. The scientist decides to share his discovery with humanity, and Joe helps to transmit the experience to others' minds, leading most of humanity to abandon Earth and transform to live on Jupiter. Simak's apocalypse is not one of destruction but isolation, causing much of humankind to die off from loneliness. Some choose to become a different species on Jupiter.

The amount of money given to foster parents differs based on location, and certain caregivers receive very little weekly to pay for things like clothing and food. According to Margaret Hodge, the Minister for Children, Young People and Families, upcoming strategies are designed to make foster parent payments more just. Local governing bodies, responsible for determining and disbursing payments, are uneasy about the source of additional funds. There are roughly 50,000 children in the UK residing with foster families, and caregivers have expressed the need for increased financial assistance. Ms. Hodge stated foster parents shouldn't have to personally pay for the expenses associated with taking care of a child, which is very important to society. She said they wanted to make sure the payment procedures for foster parents were as fair and open as possible. The proposal for a minimum payment at a national level demonstrates a commitment to improving the situation for foster parents and encouraging more people to think about becoming foster parents as a fulfilling opportunity. In order to establish a national minimum payment, the government intends to change the Children Bill, which will soon be discussed in the House of Commons. Robert Tapsfield, the executive director of the Fostering Network, was critical of the current system. He said there was no reason behind a system that gives kids different financial value depending on where they live and the lack of foster parents makes it unsustainable to expect them to pay for the costs themselves.

Plasma jets from the star ended up passing near the Sun. In 2020, people found the star and sent a team to investigate. The star had about half the Sun's mass squeezed into a small space, resulting in a surface gravity 67 billion times stronger than Earth's. Its surface was made of compressed iron with lots of neutrons. Around 3000 BC, the star cooled enough for \"chemistry\" to start, with nuclei forming \"compounds.\" Because the star's chemistry was much faster than Earth's, life appeared there quickly. Plant-like organisms showed up around 1000 BC, and later, animal-like creatures evolved, including predators. The star's intelligent species, the cheela, had bodies the mass of a human but were compressed into a tiny, flat shape due to the extreme gravity. Their eyes could only see ultraviolet and X-ray light. In 2032, the first cheela weapon was developed. The story follows the cheela civilization from May 22, 2050, to June 21, 2050. A day on Dragon's Egg lasted 0.2 seconds, and cheela lived for about 40 minutes. They developed agriculture, faced volcanic eruptions, and had to relocate. Math was invented, and the clan survived by sacrificing elders. The cheela came to worship the human spacecraft and invented writing because of the satellites' movements. The humans noticed the worship site and sent messages, and the cheela realized the beings were spindly. One cheela sent messages to the humans, who figured out the cheela's time scale. Humans sent information, and a cheela realized the supernova created both races.

{"id": 6822, "text": "A former member of the British government, Michael Heseltine, stated that the market lacks morals.\n\nStock market traders throughout Asia haven't spent much time expressing sorrow for the victims of the recent catastrophe. Stock markets in Indonesia and India have reached record highs this week. Even in Sri Lanka, which was more severely impacted, the main index has only decreased by 5% since the tsunamis occurred. Larger markets elsewhere have hardly reacted. The MSCI World share index, which gauges global stock market performance, reached its highest level this week since early 2001; the BBC Global 30 has risen by 3% in the last week. This is happening even though insurance costs are already estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars, and countries in the region are considering lowering their growth forecasts.\n\nThe markets are behaving logically.\n\nThe theoretical insurance cost of the disaster won't greatly affect corporate profits. Most victims won't have insurance. According to estimates from India, only a quarter of those affected there could afford insurance, and only a quarter of that group at most will have purchased policies. Indonesia is likely to have even lower rates of insurance coverage. Where insurance is in place, for example, in the affected tourist complexes, the costs will be absorbed by the global reinsurance market, rather than locally.\n\nStock markets don't trade the type of companies likely to have been damaged. The biggest companies traded on the Jakarta Stock Exchange are in oil, technology, and financial services, which weren't affected by the flooding. Tourist businesses, the most likely to suffer, are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. Those that are listed have suffered; Confifi Hotel Holdings, a small Sri Lankan tourism firm, has halved in value this week. There are winners and losers. Asian stock markets favor property and construction companies, many of which will benefit from reconstruction opportunities. In Indonesia, shares in state construction companies Adhi Karya and Semen Gresik have increased sharply this week.\n\nThe academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their long-term economic impact.\n\nAccording to the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at Colorado State University, there is little evidence that disasters inevitably lead to a depression. The need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is offset by the positive impact of reconstruction activity. The center states that there is rarely a rebuilding boom, but sizeable indirect losses are generally avoided. A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and 18% felt better off. The authors concluded that most businesses, even those that are hard-hit, recover.\n\nDisasters have a psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.\n\nMany analysts warn of panic spreading through the global financial system, as investors seek to protect themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unpredictable events. The risks are lower than they seem. Even the costliest natural disaster is dwarfed by the global capital market. A series of recent shocks have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion rarely happens; market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely undermine markets. The trillion-dollar debts of Japan's banks haven't affected stock markets beyond Tokyo. The US stock market was declining before 9/11, and it rose by 20% in the six months following the attacks. A Bombay trader said that the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected and business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6829, "text": "Quantum spin Hall insulators, otherwise known as 2D topological insulators, possess edge states that are resistant to nonmagnetic impurities because the only route for backscattering is blocked, making them good choices for applications involving consistent spin transport. At present, the majority of 2D topological insulators that we know of are built on a hexagonal lattice; more specifically, a honeycomb lattice. In this study, we put forward the idea that the quantum spin Hall effect exists in a buckled square lattice. Through global structure optimization, we anticipate a new three-layer quasi-2D structure for the BiF system that possesses the lowest energy of all structures having a thickness under 6.0 {\\AA}. It is recognized as a quasi-2D topological insulator that has a large band gap, measured to be 0.69 eV. The electronic states of the quasi-2D BiF system in proximity to the Fermi level are largely attributable to the central Bi square lattice, which is nestled between two inert BiF2 layers. This is advantageous because the interaction between a substrate and the quasi-2D material might not alter the system's topological properties, as we show is the situation when a NaF substrate is used. Lastly, we devised a new tight-binding model for a system with two orbitals and a buckled square lattice to clarify the low-energy physics of the quasi-2D BiF material. Our work both forecasts a quantum spin Hall insulator that can be used in real-world applications at room temperature and introduces a new lattice system for manipulating topological states, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Many measures have been developed to characterize bipartite and multipartite quantum correlations, including quantum discord. However, like entanglement measures, there's no universal method to determine if a correlation measure is appropriate, in part because of the inherent complexity. This paper attempts to address this complexity by proposing several criteria for a \"good\" correlation measure, categorized as necessary, reasonable, and debatable. Several of these criteria are then proven for generalized measures of quantum correlations. The paper provides examples demonstrating that not all measures meet all conditions. The reasonable conditions involve the continuity of correlations, a previously undiscussed property. Continuity is important for experimental investigation of quantum correlations.

{"id": 6844, "text": "Lewis's writing in Babbitt has drawn both positive and negative attention for its unconventional style. One critic observed that the story lacks a conventional plot, instead showing the protagonist aging over two years. The novel follows a chronological sequence of events in the main character's life. We are introduced to George F. Babbitt as a middle-aged man who excels at selling houses for inflated prices, and then we get a detailed account of his morning routine. Every object that Babbitt uses is described, including the modern alarm clock, which he views as a status symbol, and the rugged camp blanket, which represents the freedom and heroism of the West. While getting dressed, Babbitt carefully considers each item of his \"Solid Citizen\" outfit, with the Booster's club button being the most important, which he wears proudly. The initial seven chapters focus on Babbitt's activities during a single day. At breakfast, Babbitt shows affection for his ten-year-old daughter Tinka, attempts to discourage his twenty-two-year-old daughter Verona from her newfound socialist beliefs, and urges his seventeen-year-old son Ted to put more effort into his studies. At work, he dictates letters and discusses real estate advertising with his staff. Babbitt is a successful realtor. In the early chapters, he devotes much of his energy to climbing the social ladder through booster events, real estate deals, and cultivating relationships with important people. According to Babbitt, any \"respectable\" man in Zenith belonged to at least two or three \"lodges\" or booster clubs. These organizations provided opportunities for potential business partnerships, time away from home and family, and were simply \"the thing to do.\" Babbitt admits that while these clubs \"stimulated him like brandy,\" he often found work dull and nerve-wracking in comparison. Lewis also provides vivid descriptions of Babbitt bartering for alcohol (despite supporting Prohibition) and hosting dinner parties. At his college reunion, Babbitt reconnects with Charles McKelvey, a former classmate who became a millionaire through the construction business. Babbitt seizes the opportunity to socialize with someone from a wealthier social class by inviting the McKelveys to a dinner party. Although Babbitt hopes the party will elevate his family's social standing, the McKelveys leave early and do not reciprocate with an invitation. Gradually, Babbitt becomes aware of his dissatisfaction with \"The American Dream,\" and he attempts to suppress these feelings by going camping in Maine with his close friend and former college roommate Paul Reisling. When Babbitt and Paul arrive at the campsite, they are amazed by the beauty and simplicity of nature. As Babbitt looks out over a lake, he remarks, \"I\u2019d just like to sit here \u2013 the rest of my life \u2013 and whittle \u2013 and sit. And never hear a typewriter.\u201d Paul is similarly captivated, saying, \"Oh it\u2019s darn good, Georgie. There\u2019s something eternal about it.\u201d Despite some challenges, the two men consider the trip a success and leave feeling optimistic about the coming year. On the day Babbitt is elected vice-president of the Booster's club, he learns that Paul shot his wife Zilla. Babbitt immediately drives to the jail where Paul is being held. Babbitt is deeply disturbed by the situation and tries to find ways to help Paul. When Paul is sentenced to a three-year prison term, \u201cBabbitt returned to his office to realize that he faced a world which, without Paul, was meaningless.\u201d Shortly after Paul's arrest, Myra and Tinka leave to visit relatives, leaving Babbitt largely alone. Alone with his thoughts, Babbitt begins to question what he truly wants in life. Eventually, \u201che stumbled upon the admission that he wanted the fairy girl - in the flesh.\u201d Missing Paul, Babbitt decides to return to Maine. He envisions himself as a rugged outdoorsman and considers becoming a camp guide. However, he becomes disillusioned with the wilderness and leaves \"lonelier than he had ever been in his life.\" Eventually, Babbitt finds solace in a new client, Tanis Judique. He confides in her about the events involving Paul and Zilla, and Tanis proves to be a sympathetic listener. Over time, Babbitt begins to reject the values he once held: he becomes involved in liberal politics with the well-known socialist lawyer Seneca Doane; engages in an affair with Tanis; goes on various trips; and spends time with aspiring Bohemians and flappers in Zenith. But each attempt ultimately leaves him disillusioned with the concept of rebellion. During his outings with Tanis and her group of friends, \"the Bunch,\" he discovers that even the Bohemians have strict rules for their subculture. When Virgil Gunch and others learn about Babbitt's involvement with Seneca Doane and Tanis Judique, Virgil tries to persuade Babbitt to return to conformity and join their newly formed \"Good Citizens' League.\u201d Babbitt refuses. His former friends then ostracize him, boycotting his real estate business and publicly shunning him in clubs around town. Babbitt gradually realizes that his attempts at nonconformity are not only pointless but also destructive to the life and friends he once cherished. Yet he continues with them, even after Myra suspects his affair, though she has no solid evidence. Separately, Myra becomes seriously ill with acute appendicitis. Babbitt, experiencing a near-epiphany, rushes home and abandons all rebellion to care for his wife. During her long recovery, they spend time together, rekindling their intimacy. Soon, his old friends and colleagues welcome Babbitt back into their social circles. As a result of his philosophical wanderings being met with practical life events, he reverts to dispassionate conformity by the end; however, Babbitt never fully loses the sentimentality, empathy, and hope for a meaningful life that he has developed. In the final scene, everything in his life has been resolved, and he is back on a traditional path. He is awakened in the night to discover that his son Ted and Eunice, the daughter of his neighbor, have not returned from a party. In the morning, his wife informs him that they have been found in the house, having been married that night. While friends and family gather to disapprove of this development, Babbitt excuses himself and Ted to speak privately. He approves of the marriage, stating that while he may not agree with it, he admires Ted's decision to live life on his own terms, not conforming to societal expectations.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 6845, "text": "Roy Hodgson, formerly in charge at Blackburn, thinks the Premiership ought to adopt a winter break, like the majority of Europe. He also believes that a demanding domestic schedule won't hurt English teams' chances of winning the Champions League.\n\nHodgson, who is now the manager of Viking Stavanger, attended Liverpool's game against Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield on Tuesday as a member of Uefa's technical committee. Hodgson strongly supports the winter break that is used all over Europe, but not in England, where Champions League contenders have been playing a lot of games. Hodgson told BBC Sport that, while he supports the idea of a winter break for the Premiership, he does not think it will negatively affect English teams in the Champions League's last 16. He mentioned that it is not certain that teams who have had a break will have a clear advantage. He is a strong supporter of the break, since it allows players to recover in the middle of the season, which some think will give teams an edge in the Champions League. Another point of view is that having a break and then coming back puts you at a disadvantage. The bigger discussions about the winter break should be about the nature of football today, the needs of football players, and the way the Premiership has grown, rather than just a few Champions League matches in February.\n\nHodgson thinks a winter break has many benefits and is a great opportunity to recharge. He added that if he were still a manager in England, he would support calls for its introduction. In the pre-season, there is a lot of energy and enthusiasm, but by the time Christmas rolls around, many players are tired because they have played in many international matches for their club and country and traveled a lot. The break gives them a chance to get that energy and enthusiasm back, and, more importantly, to recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead. The mental part is by far the most important.\n\nHodgson also said that breaks can be different lengths. In Italy, the break was very short, just Christmas and New Year. It was so short that nothing was done. The players were given a week or 10 days off, then they trained for a week or 10 days, and then they played a game. If it is longer, it is important for those in charge of physical fitness to give the players a program to follow to make sure they keep the physical strength they have built up.\n\nHodgson thinks a winter break would be a positive move for the Premiership. If we are talking about football at the highest level, which the Premiership is, then he would support a winter break. If you look at how demanding the Premier League is, especially for players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would be very good for them, both physically and mentally.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

A deep stacked transformations (DST) method is introduced to improve domain generalization through a series of transformations applied to images during training, addressing domain-specific shifts. The method is evaluated on prostate, left atrial, and left ventricle segmentation tasks using MRI and ultrasound data. Results show that DST models trained on small datasets exhibit less performance decline on unseen datasets compared to standard augmentation and domain adaptation methods. Also, DST performs better on the same domain albeit slightly. When trained on larger datasets, DST achieves state-of-the-art results on unseen domains.

Animalistic symbolism is interwoven throughout the story. Hooper torments and bullies Kingshaw, establishing Kingshaw as the victim. They visit Hang Wood, where Hooper displays vulnerabilities, and Kingshaw gains some advantage. However, Kingshaw lacks the capacity for deliberate cruelty. This pattern of abuse persists within Warings' secluded environment. The adults remain ignorant of the conflict and their children's behaviors. The characters go to Hang Wood several times. Hooper seems insecure in this location, away from his residence. The family arranges a visit to Leydell Castle. Kingshaw takes advantage of Hooper's phobias as they climb the ancient structure. Hooper falls and suffers serious injuries. Even though Kingshaw tried to help him, Hooper says that Kingshaw pushed him, and the adults believe Hooper. Kingshaw becomes convinced that he caused Hooper's injuries. During Hooper's recovery, Kingshaw appears to become more independent. He also becomes friends with a local boy named Fielding. Fielding is confident, and he invites Kingshaw to his family farm, where Kingshaw observes the birth of a calf. This is unlike Warings, which is full of morbidity.

Until now, it's only been done for two specific points in solid crystals: phosphorus in silicon (using electrical detection via a single electron transistor) and nitrogen-vacancy points in diamond (using optical detection). Both electrical and optical detection have shown about 90% accuracy in spin detection. However, electrical detection suffers from heat restrictions, and optical detection struggles with poor photon collection, both preventing the high accuracy needed for quantum information technologies. This text details a combined method using optical stimulation to alter a defect center's charge state within a silicon-based transistor, dependent on its spin state, followed by electrical detection of this change. High-resolution optical frequency targeting overcomes the thermal limitations of previous electrical detection, and charge sensing bypasses the challenges of effective photon collection. This is demonstrated using erbium in silicon, potentially opening new designs for quantum information processing devices and greatly expanding the variety of usable defect centers. Moreover, effectively detecting the optical stimulation of individual locations in silicon electrically is a significant advancement toward creating a connection between silicon-based and optical-based quantum computing technologies.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6897, "text": "Deep learning models have shown great promise in areas like medical image analysis. These models are often criticized for their lack of transparency making them difficult to interpret, understand, and refine because there's no comprehensive method for designing them. A technique called precision learning sought to combine deep architectures with more established techniques. Networks built this way gain benefits from the initial operator, have fewer parameters, and improved interpretability. They do not always perform at the highest levels, though. The study described explores deep networks by using known operators, employing a strategy of breaking the network down to replace components while preserving how well it works. This research focuses on segmenting retinal vessels. It starts with a high-performing U-Net, and by gradually changing components, it shows that the network can be divided into modules of known operators. The outcomes show that a combination of a guided filter that can be trained and a trainable version of the Frangi filter can perform at a level similar to U-Net while significantly decreasing the number of parameters. Furthermore, the layers that were trained can be associated with their initial algorithmic interpretation and can be analyzed using typical signal processing tools.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Their connection deepens over a decade. During this period, Leo presents Alma with three books, as she is his sole confidante. His first book lacks appeal due to its realism, the second is implausible fiction, and the last, \"The History of Love,\" is devoted to Alma. Leo vows eternal love for Alma. Alma, now twenty, is sent to the United States by her father, fearing the rise of fascist Germany. Unaware of Alma's pregnancy, Leo dreams of joining her in America. Shortly after, Germany invades Poland, and Leo hides in the woods, surviving on foraged food and stolen goods. After two years, he travels to America, finds Alma, but is heartbroken to learn she believed him dead and married another man. He is further devastated to discover she had another child with her husband. Despite his pleas, Alma refuses to leave with him but reveals the existence of his five-year-old son, Isaac. Crushed, Leo becomes a locksmith. He secretly watches Isaac, longing to be involved in his life but hesitant to approach him. In the present, Leo is an isolated elderly man awaiting death, accompanied by his recently rediscovered childhood friend, Bruno, particularly after Alma's death five years prior. Leo tracks his son's success as a writer, attributing Isaac's talent to himself. Leo's despair intensifies upon learning of Isaac's death at sixty, and he becomes obsessed with securing his place in his son's legacy, even breaking into Isaac's house to check if he had read \"Words for Everything.\" Leo seeks a copy of \"The History of Love,\" which he gifted to Zvi Litvinoff, a friend who immigrated to Chile. Their friendship began when Leo, gravely ill in Poland, wrote his obituary, which Zvi stole to preserve Leo's life. Leo writes to Zvi, but Zvi's wife claims the book was destroyed in a flood, concealing that her husband plagiarized the work. Unbeknownst to Leo, the book was published in Spanish under Zvi's name, who felt guilty and included Leo's stolen obituary as the final chapter. Zvi's wife, Rosa, lied about the book's destruction and staged a flood to maintain her husband's reputation. Zvi later died without revealing the truth about \"The History of Love's\" true author. In a parallel narrative, fifteen-year-old Alma Singer, named after the Alma in \"The History of Love,\" struggles with her father's death from cancer. Her mother becomes withdrawn, focusing on book translation. Her brother, Bird, seeks solace in religion, believing himself to be chosen by God. Alma finds comfort in her father's survivalist hobbies. She has a crush on her pen pal, Misha, who moves to New York. Their relationship ends due to Alma's uncertainty. Her mother receives a letter from Jacob Marcus, requesting a translation of \"The History of Love\" for a large sum. Alma's mother is suspicious, but Jacob claims the book holds sentimental value from his childhood. Alma sees this as an opportunity to help her mother and embellishes her letters to Jacob. When the letters stop, Alma decides to find the mysterious client. She concludes that the Alma in the book was real and begins searching for her. She discovers that Alma married and is now known as Moritz but has been dead for five years. She learns that Isaac Moritz is Alma's son and a famous writer. Reading his book, she realizes that Isaac hired her mother to translate it but is now deceased. To confirm her suspicions, Alma leaves a note on Isaac's door asking about the novel's author. Bird finds Alma's diary, misinterprets the names Alma Mereminski and Alma Moritz, and believes Leopold Gursky is Alma's real father. To redeem himself, Bird arranges a meeting between Alma and Gursky. Both are confused by the letter: Alma wonders who sent it, while Leo believes it was Alma despite her death. Leo waits on a park bench, reflecting on his life and mortality. He imagines dying there. When Alma appears, they are both confused. Leo initially mistakes her for his Alma from the past but realizes she is different. He speaks briefly about Bruno and Isaac. Alma begins to understand Leo's identity. When she asks if he ever loved an Alma Mereminski, Leo feels recognized and taps his fingers twice against her. She hugs him, and he says her name, giving her a sense of recognition as well. The novel's ending is ambiguous, with some believing Leo dies, while others see it as a transcendent moment for both characters. The final chapter, \"The Death of Leopold Gursky,\" is the same as Leo's self-written obituary in \"The History of Love,\" emphasizing the theme of how words preserve people's memory. Zvi Litvinoff carried Leo's obituary as a talisman, and insisted on including it in the book to keep Leo \"alive\" in the hearts of readers. Nicole Krauss includes the same obituary at the end of her novel, encouraging readers to remember Leo.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This also needs 1 cup of coconut cream (again, boxed coconut cream is preferred), 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, and 1 fresh or frozen pandan leaf tied in a knot.\n\nThe dish is also prepared with 3 large, ripe Ataulfo mangoes that have been peeled.\n\nToasted sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon, are optional.\n\nTo prepare the salty-sweet coconut cream topping: the 2 cups of coconut cream, the 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar, and the 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt must be mixed in a small pot. The pandan leaf must then be added to the pot, and it's acceptable if it isn't fully submerged. The pot is then placed over high heat and the mixture is brought to a simmer, being careful not to let it boil, then the heat is lowered to low. The pot is then covered and cooked until the cream has thickened a bit and has been infused with the pandan flavor, approximately 10 minutes. The pandan leaf is then removed and discarded. The cream can be stored covered at room temperature for up to 2 hours.\n\nTo prepare the sweet sticky rice: the soaking water is poured off. The rice is placed in a fine mesh strainer that is inside a large bowl. The bowl is filled with enough cool tap water to cover the rice by an inch or two. The rice is gently stirred with a hand, then the strainer is lifted from the bowl. The water in the bowl will be cloudy due to the rice starch. The water is then emptied, the strainer is put back in the bowl, and the process is repeated until the water is mostly clear. This water changing process may need to be repeated two or three times. The rice is then drained. Enough water is poured into the sticky rice steamer pot to reach a depth of about 2 inches. The water is brought to a boil over high heat. The rice is then added to the mesh bag and the bag is put in the basket, or the woven steamer basket is lined with two layers of damp cheesecloth and the rice is dumped onto the cheesecloth. The bag or cheesecloth is folded so that it covers the rice, and the bundle is patted so the rice is in a mostly even layer, and it is covered with a pot lid or clean, damp kitchen cloth, tucking it around the bundle. The heat is then slightly decreased to maintain a steady, but not furious boil, and the basket is placed into the pot. It should be cooked until the grains are completely tender but a bit underdone, around 12 minutes rather than the more typical 15 minutes. While this cooks, the 1 cup of coconut cream, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of salt must be combined in a medium pot. The pandan leaf is added to the pot, and it's placed over high heat, and the mixture is brought to a simmer, being careful not to let it boil. It's cooked while stirring, until the sugar has fully dissolved, around a minute. The heat is turned off, the pot is covered, and the mixture is left to sit so it is infused with the flavor of pandan, approximately 5 minutes. The pandan leaf is then removed and discarded. This cream mixture must cool until it's warm but no longer hot. The cooked sticky rice is then added to the pot and it's gently stirred and folded until it is evenly coated in the cream mixture. The pot is covered and left to sit for 10 minutes. The rice will become more tender and absorb the coconut mixture. The sticky rice mixture can be stored, covered, in the fridge for up to a day. To reheat, it's covered with plastic wrap and microwaved on low just until the rice is warm, but not hot, throughout, and it's served immediately.\n\nTo serve: Each mango is cut lengthwise on both sides of the pit to remove the flesh in two large pieces. The pieces are then cut crosswise into slices that are about 1/2 inch thick. Between 3/4 and 1 cup of the sweet sticky rice is placed on each of 6 plates, and it's gently pressed to make an even layer, and then the mangoes are divided evenly on top.

Groups opposing the hunt, such as the League Against Cruel Sports, dispatched monitors to observe the hunts for any unlawful behavior. According to Mike Hobday of the league, any video evidence of illegal acts would be given to the police. Hobday stated that the evidence suggested most hunts followed the law, with many simply gathering and dispersing, peacefully walking their hounds, or participating in drag hunting, while reports of suspected illegal activity by various hunts across Britain were received.

However, there is a lack of microscopic understanding of how carriers are changed in electric double-layer transistors because it is hard to see the interface between the electrolyte and the semiconductor. This work shows real-space mapping of channel conductance in zinc oxide electric double-layer transistors using a special microscope at very low temperatures. A thin layer of ionic gel, typically less than 50 nm thick, allows for high-resolution imaging below the surface. This imaging is done while still being able to make the material go from a metal to an insulator by applying a voltage. The images clearly show how the channel conductance changes over space and its variations during the transition, as well as the uneven conductance distribution caused by a large voltage difference.

{"id": 6951, "text": "Baby Wise outlines an infant care system based on cycles of eating, activity, and rest. The authors call their feeding strategy \"parent-directed feeding,\" or PDF. The book offers guidance for infant care from birth to six months. It mainly deals with infant sleep and feeding habits and stresses parental command of infant training. The infant is depicted as a \"welcome addition\" to the household, not its focal point, and subject to the home's general organization. The material in Baby Wise is not groundbreaking but a restatement of different practical approaches similar to parenting styles recommended by other Evangelical parenting experts. Ezzo and Bucknam define their position as a compromise between feeding the baby whenever the baby signals hunger and feeding according to a set timetable. Unlike the advice of well-known pediatrician William \"Dr. Bill\" Sears, the Baby Wise authors do not approve of co-sleeping; Ezzo stated that the most severe sleep issues they have seen are linked to parents sleeping with their children. The sleep advice from Baby Wise is akin to that of Richard Ferber in his popular book, Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems. The Ferber method of helping a baby fall asleep involves putting the baby to bed while awake, which is the same as in Baby Wise. The baby should learn to fall asleep independently. Both approaches advise parents against using props like pacifiers to help the baby sleep, and both describe putting the infant to sleep without first rocking, cuddling, or nursing simply to calm the child into sleep. It is expected that the infant will \"cry it out\" during the initial training phases until around eight weeks old. A basic principle of the book is that \"great marriages produce great parents.\" Ezzo and Bucknam advise new parents to continue dating each other and inviting friends over. The book's buyers include mothers tired of the demands of attachment parenting who are looking for more time for their jobs and passions. The book promises that following its plan \"will not leave mom ragged at the end of the day nor in bondage to her child. Nor will Dad be excluded from his duties.\"", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Training these networks for semantic segmentation necessitates considerable labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to create. Semi-supervised learning methods tackle this problem by using unlabeled data, lessening the labeled data needed for training. Data augmentation methods, like CutMix and ClassMix, create more training data from existing labeled data. This paper introduces ComplexMix, a novel data augmentation approach combining aspects of CutMix and ClassMix for better performance. The proposed method can manage the complexity of augmented data while aiming for semantic accuracy, balancing complexity and correctness. ComplexMix is assessed on a typical semantic segmentation dataset and contrasted with current techniques. Experiments demonstrate that this method improves upon current techniques on standard semantic image segmentation datasets.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Although the Hilbert polynomial is not constant in singular families, it displays upper semi-continuous behavior. This property allows for the construction of a determinant morphism for flat families of coherent sheaves, aligning with the standard determinant morphism in the smooth case.

The suggested approach employs a super-pixel-based image segmenter to divide an image into several regions. A deep convolutional neural network is created to operate on each segment, identifying text of diverse shapes, sizes, and structures. It surpasses other methods in detecting text in images, especially those where text of different kinds and sizes is densely packed with other objects in a small area.

According to Mr. McConnell, the nation's health statistics were \"deplorable,\" largely due to smoking. He stated that businesses would face fines of up to \u00a32,500, and licenses would be revoked for non-compliance. Previously, the Scottish Executive explored several options but decided unanimously to implement a comprehensive smoking ban in public spaces. Mr. McConnell stated in a statement to parliament that the licensed trade would be invited to join an expert committee before the ban took effect.\n\nHe informed MSPs that the health arguments greatly outweighed continuing public concern about a complete ban and claims from the licensed trade that jobs would be lost. According to him, an international marketing campaign would be launched to ensure that \"tourists can enjoy a smoke-free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past.\" He declared, \"There are still national habits that hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health.\" \"Health rates are deplorable due to a lack of exercise, drug abuse, excessive drinking, and over-eating.\" \"They all contribute to making us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many people smoke.\" \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of \u00a31,000. \n\nMr. McConnell asserted that there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers quit or smoke less. He claimed that cigarette sales in New York had fallen by 13% and in Ireland by 16%. Mr. McConnell added that tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants had increased by nearly 9%, while volume sales in Ireland had fallen by only 1.3%, where they had been declining prior to the ban.

{"id": 6976, "text": "Two-dimensional material-based nanopore membranes with extreme resolution have been used for DNA sequencing. Molybdenum disulfide is one such material due to its stability and sensitivity which allows for high throughput. Creating nanopores with nanometer precision has traditionally involved focused electron beams within a transmission electron microscope. However, this technique has drawbacks such as high cost, time consumption, scalability issues, and control limitations below 1 nm. A new, convenient, and scalable method was developed that takes advantage of the electrochemical activity of molybdenum disulfide to precisely create sub-nanometer nanopores in single-layer molybdenum disulfide through electrochemical reaction. This electrochemical reaction commences at defects or single atom vacancies on the molybdenum disulfide surface, followed by the progressive removal of individual atoms or unit cells from the molybdenum disulfide lattice, ultimately resulting in nanopore formation. Variations in the ionic current passing through the enlarging nanopore allow for direct monitoring of the nanopore size, which can be determined using a conductance vs. pore size model. Moreover, DNA movement can be observed in real time with these molybdenum disulfide nanopores. This method's atomic precision and ease of use could lead to large-scale nanopore production in two-dimensional membranes, making solid-state nanopore sequencing possible.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

A group called the Caretakers forms at Oxford, including Hugo Dyson and Owen Barfield, who become close friends. John and Jack consider making Hugo an apprentice Caretaker of the Imaginarium Geographica and the Archipelago because they've become such good friends. Soon after they show Hugo the Geographica, Hugo shows them a book that Charles, who is in France, sent him. The book has a foreword supposedly written by Hugo in his own blood that is quite mysterious. They choose to go for a walk to clear their heads after all the confusion. Hugo goes through a door in the wood and disappears in time. At first, Hugo believes this is a prank by his companions, but later finds this is not the case. John and Jack meet the Royal Animal Rescue Team, a team of badgers whose leaders are Uncas, Tummeler's son, and his son Fred. They tell the men that fourteen years ago, they were ordered to save John, Jack, and Charles from an unknown event in the near future. As they are preparing to leave, Uncas unknowingly shuts the mysterious door, causing the rescue team and the area surrounding Oxford to vanish. The group notices that the new desiccated land before them is called Albion and sets out to see what has become of their world. They escape from giants contained in a tower and are rescued from a Wicker Man by a man called Chaz. Resembling Charles, the two men and badgers realize that \"Chaz\" is not the Charles they know. The party is sure that Chaz is Charles, from a different timeline in which Mordred, the Winter King, rules and the Archipelago is destroyed, even though Chaz is rough, scared, and distrustful from his years of surviving. Chaz leads the group to Bert, who gives John the skull of Jules Verne, a map, and the Serendipity Box which gives the opener the thing he needs most. Mordred appears, thanks to Chaz's betrayal, and binds the men and badgers using their true names before leaving. Uncas releases the men, who use a scarab brooch given to him by the Serendipity Box and, with Bert, create an ocean and the Red Dragon that the companions leave on, except for Bert, who stays behind. The party discovers a time machine created by Jules Verne on an island for them to fix the problem that Hugo created, which led to the creation of Albion. The time machine works like a projector, and the first slide is of Ancient Greece, where the companions encounter two twins, Myrddyn and Madoc. They deduce that one of them is the Cartographer of Lost Places and the other is Mordred. In the next slide, the companions visit the Library of Alexandria and find Meridian(Myrddyn), the twin who becomes the Cartographer. They discover that the Holy Grail is being held in this library, and that Madoc, the twin who becomes Mordred, has been sleeping with her. Meridian binds Madoc, and Chaz unknowingly uses his fire balls to cause the fire that destroyed the Library of Alexandria as they try to escape. In the third slide, the companions meet Hugo and witness the Tournament of Champions, which determines the next ruler of Meridian's Precinct, modern-day Britain. The tournament's three main entrants are Merlin, who is the Cartographer, Mordred, and Thorn, a young boy destined to become the Arthur, or High King. Hugo throws a dagger at Mordred during the fight between Merlin and Mordred to stop him from becoming King. Hugo disqualifies Merlin and Mordred, allowing Thorn to become Arthur. However, Arthur does not command the loyalty of the people as he would if the fight continued normally. The companions fight in a civil war against Arthur in the fourth slide, as Merlin has allied with the local rulers to gain the crown. Mordred has allied with Arthur. Mordred kills Arthur when Arthur tries to reason with him. The companions learn that the Holy Grail can resurrect Arthur. They travel to Avalon, meet the priestess that slept with Mordred, and bring back her daughter. They must leave Chaz, who becomes the first Guardian of Avalon, or the Green Knight. The companions give Chaz the Lance of Longinus. Rose, the priestess's daughter, revives Arthur, who cuts off Mordred's hand when he attempts to kill Merlin. Mordred disappears. Arthur summons the dragons, uniting the fiefdoms and ending the civil war. Merlin departs to become the Cartographer. In the fifth slide, the companions meet Geoffrey of Monmouth and journey to the Keep of Time, where they talk with the Cartographer, who gives them a key to access the top room of the Keep of Time, the future. The party exits the door they initially entered and are summoned to speak with Richard Burton. He tells them that, with the support of the Imperial Cartological Society, he caused Hugo to travel to the past to show the Caretakers that Mordred was simply a victim of fate. He was unaware of Albion's creation when Hugo violated the contest. He also could not see Rose, addressing Hugo, Bert, John, Jack, and Charles as though they were the only ones present. In a pre-World War II setting, it is hinted that Mordred has rediscovered the Lance of Longinus and is ready to launch another attack.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This paper uses the Deffuant-Weisbuch model, a well-known model from statistical physics and social dynamics, for image segmentation. The Deffuant-Weisbuch model, previously used to represent how interacting agents' opinions change to form groups with similar views, is applied here by treating pixels as agents and their colors as opinions, updating these opinions according to the model. The paper adapts the basic model by including adjacency and neighborhood details to account for image characteristics like local similarity. The algorithm stops when the number of unique pixel opinions, representing color centers, equals the desired number of clusters. Tests on images from the Berkeley Image Segmentation Dataset show through both qualitative and quantitative analysis that this straightforward method holds promise for image segmentation. This application represents the first successful use of such a statistical physics and social dynamics model in image processing, according to the author's knowledge.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 6996, "text": "Lincoln Rhyme, along with Thom and Amelia Sachs, travels outside the city for an experimental spinal procedure that could either help or hurt his quadriplegia. Sheriff Jim Bell, cousin to Rhyme's NYPD colleague Ronald Bell, asks for their help with a kidnapping and potential rape case. The suspect is believed to be Garret, a local orphan nicknamed \"The insect boy\" for his insect fascination, who is suspected of other crimes, including a woman's death by hornet stings. At the beginning, Garret kidnaps Lydia, a nurse, from the location of the first victim's abduction. A deputy dies from hornets while searching Garret's hideout. Rhyme reluctantly agrees to assist, and he and Sachs use trace evidence to track Garret. The story follows Garret and Lydia as he brings her to his main hideout. Rhyme outsmarts Garret, who is arrested, and Sachs questions him to find Mary-Beth's location. Garret claims \"The man in the tan overalls\" is responsible, which Sachs believes, but the police do not. Sachs then helps Garret escape from jail. The police, including Rhyme, pursue Sachs, who accidentally kills a deputy and becomes a fugitive. They reach Garret's safe house where he confesses he lied about \"the man in tan overalls\" but denies intending harm to Mary-Beth. A group of armed locals, hoping to claim Mary-Beth's mother's reward money, attacks the police, Thom, and Rhyme who have arrived. Several deputies die, but Sachs and Deputy Lucy kill the attackers. Thom is discovered to have been shot inside the hut. Back in town, Sachs and Garret are jailed, while Thom is hospitalized. Rhyme, suspicious, tells Bell he thinks a local businessman producing illegal pesticide is responsible for the town's murders, silencing those who inquired about pesticide-related illnesses. Rhyme also believes the businessman had Garret's family killed in a staged car crash to acquire their land for pesticide shipments. Bell then tries to kill Rhyme with a pesticide sample, revealing his involvement in the scheme. Lucy overhears and restrains Bell, who is angry to learn Rhyme tricked him by using moonshine instead of pesticide. Bell is arrested. Garret is freed after Mary-Beth drops the charges due to Garret's protective actions. Mary-Beth unearths his family's remains, making her a target. Sachs accepts a plea deal for a reduced sentence. Just as sentencing is about to begin, Rhyme presents evidence that the deputy Sachs shot was involved in the murders, and Sachs is freed because her act was considered self-defense. Later, Rhyme is hospitalized, Thom is recovering, and Rhyme is to have the spinal surgery he delayed. As he is taken into the operating room, Lydia, the kidnapped nurse, follows him to thank him. Under anesthesia, Rhyme hears Lydia reveal she was the sheriff's mistress, reporting pesticide-related illnesses to have people silenced, then she ominously tells him \"accidents happen in spinal surgery\". Sachs realizes Lydia, an oncology nurse, is in the neurosurgery ward and intervenes. The novel concludes with Rhyme, Sachs, Lucy, Thom, and Garret at Garret's family's burial. Lucy may become Garret's foster mother. Rhyme does not have the surgery and is back on a ventilator, requiring another year to regain his original physical status after Lydia tried to stop his oxygen flow.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

William Gallas and Damien Duff might also miss the Barcelona match. Gallas, a French defender, and Duff, an Irish winger, were both injured near the end of the game at St James' Park.\n\nBridge's injury, along with Mourinho using all three substitutions and Carlo Cudicini's red card, meant Chelsea ended the game with a limited number of players. Cudicini was slated to play in the Carling Cup final but will now miss it due to suspension. The manager is not planning to add anyone to the squad before the Barcelona game, even though there are few options to replace Bridge at left-back.\n\nCelestine Babayaro left the club in January to join Newcastle. Gallas has played at left-back before, but he might not be fit. Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, might switch to left-back, with Glen Johnson, who played as goalkeeper at the end of the Newcastle game, playing on the right. Young players like Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan, and Sam Tillen could be options, but Mourinho is unlikely to use an inexperienced player in the Champions League. Bridge's injury also means Mourinho won't have a senior left-back for the rest of the season, even though he wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal.\n\nMourinho said that Bridge likely would not play against Barcelona or Liverpool and may not play again this season. The medical team will try to recover Gallas and Duff. He stated that he would not complain about injuries because they will have enough players to play.

{"id": 6998, "text": "The company Gartner's research indicates that cell phone sales are experiencing a very successful period. Over 674 million units were sold across the globe the previous year, according to their report. This total was the largest one ever recorded and was a 30% increase over the sales numbers from 2003, even exceeding the most ambitious expectations, as per Gartner's findings. Analysts suggest that enhanced design and the visual appeal of mobile devices, coupled with the introduction of new services like downloading music, could contribute to boosting sales figures this year. Gartner also noted that while people continued to seek improved replacement phones, data suggested some markets might be witnessing a deceleration in these types of sales.\n\nCarolina Milanesi, a mobile analyst, mentioned to BBC News that every market expanded, except for Japan. She added that this indicated that replacement sales were ongoing in Western Europe. According to her, Japan foreshadows where markets in North America and Western Europe could be headed in a couple of years. The population in Japan already has TV, music, ringtones, cameras, and everything imaginable on cell phones, which has led to people discontinuing purchasing replacement devices.\n\nGartner believes there could be a slight slump in sales in the European and US markets, too, as people are waiting to see future mobile technology innovations. Mobile companies must carefully consider their new models' offerings to provide consumers with compelling reasons to upgrade, according to Gartner. Third-generation cell phones that can manage large amounts of data transfer, such as video, might drive people to upgrade. However, Ms. Milanesi stated it was difficult to predict the pace at which that would happen. She added that the majority of people who don't care about technology already have cameras and color screens on their devices, meaning that the data speed on a phone is not crucial to them. Furthermore, the rapid production of two or three-megapixel camera phones would not, on its own, motivate mobile owners to upgrade. Most camera phone models can't compete with digital cameras, which come with flashes and zooms.\n\nFocus on design and appearance, along with music services, would more likely drive sales this year. She noted that the Motorola Razr V3 phone exemplifies the design considerations that would be more common this year. According to her, this wasn't solely a \"women's thing,\" but rather a desire from both men and women to possess a gadget that allows for self-expression. It wasn't just about the phone's functionality, but rather what it communicated about its owner. Ms. Milanesi remarked that Western Europe has always been a design-conscious market.\n\nShe added that people want something visually appealing, along with the entertainment aspect. Music will play a role this year. According to Jupiter Research, the full-track music download market was valued at only $20 million last year, but it's projected to be worth $1.8 billion by 2009. Sony Ericsson recently launched its Walkman-branded cell phone, the W800, that merges a digital music player with up to 30 hours of battery life and a two-megapixel camera. Last year, Motorola and Apple announced the release of a version of iTunes online music downloading service that would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones. Apple stated that the new iTunes music player would be Motorola's standard music application for its music phones. However, if mobile music wants to rival digital music players like the iPod, balancing storage capacity with battery life will be a challenge. Ms. Milanesi said that it was likely that more models with hard drives would be released this coming year. But those would more likely compete with the smaller-capacity music players that have around four gigabytes of storage capacity, which wouldn't strain the battery life as much.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 7003, "text": "Nicholas Negroponte, from MIT's Media Labs, is creating a sub-$100 laptop. He informed the BBC World Service's Go Digital program of its potential use in developing countries for education. He feels that each child having a laptop could significantly help the child, their family, village, and surrounding area; the laptop would serve as a textbook. The machine is a basic laptop using a Linux-based system. He mentioned the need to reduce display costs to under $20 by projecting the image instead of using a flat panel. He also said that reducing bulk would allow for faster speeds and the use of smaller processors and slower memory. The device will likely be shipped as a kit for local assembly to minimize expenses. Negroponte acknowledged that while this is a non-profit endeavor, component manufacturers would profit. Negroponte, author of the book Being Digital, based the concept on Maine experiments where kids used laptops for schoolwork at home. Although popular with students, the Maine idea was initially met with some teacher resistance and laptop breakage issues. He modified this idea for his work in Cambodia, where he established two schools with his wife and provided the children with laptops. He claims that only one of the 25 laptops distributed three years ago has broken, with the children using the laptops not just as a textbook but also as a TV, phone, and games machine. Negroponte hopes laptops will be more prevalent than mobile phones, despite acknowledging it's a huge undertaking. He noted that the number of laptops required to exceed mobile phone use is large, but also stated that the goal is not just for the next three to five years, but rather for months. He intends to start distributing them by the end of 2006 and is negotiating with the Chinese education ministry, who are anticipated to place a substantial order.

He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1902 and some mistakenly reported that he had won. During a train ride from P\u00e4rnu to St. Petersburg, he reflects on many moments from his past. He recalls his initial encounter with his wife, Kati, at her father\u2019s residence. He recounts the discovery of his \"double,\" Georg Friedrich Martens, a man whose life closely mirrored Friedrich\u2019s eighty-nine years prior. Georg was born in Hamburg, Germany, studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, and also became a professor of international law.

He recalls a meeting with Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov, the Imperial Chancellor, to discuss a collection of treaties between Russia and other countries. He articulates his concept of \"comparativist psychology.\" He recounts, with some awkwardness, the story of his Nobel Peace Prize nomination and the erroneous reports of his victory. He explains his \"doctrine of respect for human rights.\" He tells of his affair with Yvette Arlon, an art student who later had his child, got married, and escaped to the Congo. Friedrich engages in a political discussion with a fellow train passenger, an Estonian woman and socialist named Hella Wuolijoki. He ponders how his life might have been different if he had another chance. He remembers the embarrassing incident involving the Treaty of Portsmouth, where Friedrich was a member of the Russian delegation, but his name was accidentally left off the initial list, preventing his participation in most of the discussions.

Instead of learning the metric between pictures like in standard Deep Metric Learning, each pixel is considered a sample. Pixels' embedded features in high-dimensional space create triples, and the IS-Triplet loss is optimized to increase the distance between pixels of different categories compared to those of the same category. This makes it easier to differentiate pixels from different categories in the high-dimensional feature space. An efficient triple sampling strategy is provided to enable practical IS-Triplet loss computation. The IS-Triplet loss is used with three standard image segmentation losses to do image segmentation. The suggested method is used for image co-segmentation and assessed on the SBCoseg and Internet datasets.

Recognizing that doctors repeatedly examine internal and external intensity changes to define boundaries, this segmentation process models the learning of two-way sequential patches originating from the object's center. This is achieved with a ConvRNN network incorporating a gated memory propagation unit. Unlike other interactive approaches needing bounding boxes or seed points, this method only requires a rough center point click, improving performance and reducing time. The method is applied within a multi-level structure for increased effectiveness, and it is tested on CT kidney tumors, MR prostate images, and the PROMISE12 challenge, with results that are favorable compared to current methods.

They, along with Peter and Annette, their two servants, find themselves stuck when they can no longer see the road. Pierre goes to find a light he sees far from the carriage. A stranger answers the door when Pierre knocks on an old little house. The stranger gives him a room and locks him in. Later, the stranger unlocks the door and is dragging a beautiful young woman named Adeline. The stranger tells Pierre that if he wants to live, he must swear to take her where he will never see her again, or just agree to take her with him. Pierre agrees to take Adeline, and the stranger takes them to the carriage where Madame is still inside. The family, plus Adeline, head into the dark forest, trying not to be seen and following the stranger's warning not to go back to where they just were. Eventually, they find safety in an old, ruined abbey after a wagon wheel breaks. Everyone except Peter is initially scared of what might be in the abbey. Peter checks and finds only mice, owls, bats, and other small animals. The family and Adeline, still afraid of being caught by debt collectors, stay near the abbey. Peter goes to Auboine to get the supplies to fix the wagon wheel. He tells Pierre when he gets back that he got into a fight in town and couldn't get the supplies, but he did buy some food. The family and servants make themselves at home in the abbey, making each room more livable. After some time, Peter runs into a gentleman who asks about the La Motte family. Thinking they are creditors, the family, Adeline, and the servants hide through a trap door Pierre found in one of the bedrooms. They spend the night in the dark and scary rooms, where Pierre finds a skeleton in a chest. The next day, they decide to send Adeline to see if anyone is at the abbey because no one would recognize her. She meets a young man while greeting one of her woodland animal friends. Adeline soon finds out that this stranger is actually Pierre and Madame\u2019s son, Louis. They had left Paris without telling him, and he came to find them. Soon after, Madame tells Louis that she is jealous and afraid that Adeline wants to have an affair with her husband. Louis is supposed to find out where Pierre has been spending his days, but he loses sight of his father in the forest. Madame is still mean to Adeline, believing that she is having an affair with Pierre. At the same time, Louis has fallen in love with Adeline and wants to help her in any way he can. Louis shows his affection for Adeline, but she treats it as a passing thing. One stormy night, they hear horses near the abbey. The riders are the Marquis de Montalt, who owns the abbey, and his attendants, including Theodore. Pierre becomes more worried after the Marquis appears. Louis notices this, but he has to leave to go back to his regiment. During this time, Theodore tries to warn Adeline that he thinks she is being tricked and is in danger. Before he can talk to her, he is also sent back to his regiment. Pierre and the Marquis are talking in private at the same time. After Theodore leaves, Adeline is afraid her father will come back for her when she overhears Pierre and the Marquis talking. She tells Pierre her fears, and he lets her believe that is what they were talking about. Also, Adeline finds a manuscript written by someone who was held captive in the abbey in 1642. The writer talks about his terrible situation and that he is about to die at the hands of someone unknown. Adeline sees that the manuscript is hard to read and incomplete, suggesting more than it says. Adeline tells Pierre about the manuscript when she reaches a particularly scary part. Then, Peter warns Adeline of danger, trying several times to tell her what is happening before finally explaining what he found out. Adeline discovers the truth about the conversations between the Marquis and Pierre: The Marquis wants to marry Adeline and was discussing it with Pierre. However, Adeline finds out through Peter that the Marquis is already married and the marriage would be fake and she would be the Marquis\u2019 mistress. Adeline does not want to be either the Marquis\u2019 wife or mistress. Peter and Adeline make a plan to help her escape the abbey and a situation that could ruin her reputation. Unfortunately, Adeline is tricked during her escape and taken to the Marquis\u2019 residence. Adeline tries to escape the Marquis by climbing out the window, where she runs into Theodore, who is there to rescue her. They leave in a carriage, and the Marquis quickly follows. Adeline and Theodore stop at an inn, where the Marquis finds them. Theodore, who was sick but is getting better, wounds the Marquis. Now he is in trouble not only for leaving his regiment but also for wounding a superior officer. Adeline realizes she is in love with Theodore while he is sick. Theodore is imprisoned, and Adeline is returned to Pierre de la Motte at the abbey. The Marquis tells Pierre that he now wants to kill Adeline instead of marrying her. Pierre is trapped by his own crimes. He knows that because he is in the Marquis\u2019 power, he must either agree to commit a horrible act or give up his fortune, freedom, and possibly his life. Pierre cannot allow Adeline to be killed, so he sends Adeline with Peter on horseback to Peter\u2019s sister\u2019s house in Leloncourt. When they arrive, Adeline becomes ill and is cared for by Peter\u2019s sister and later by Clara la Luc. Adeline is exhausted and sick, but she cannot sleep and keeps thinking about the past and imagining a gloomy future. After her illness, Adeline is adopted by Arnaud la Luc, Clara\u2019s father, and spends her time with the family. Clara also has a brother, but he is not there. Soon, Monsieur la Luc\u2019s health is failing, and the family has to move to a different climate for a while. Eventually, Louis de la Motte finds Adeline and tells her about Theodore, who is imprisoned and about to be executed for assaulting his general officer. Monsieur la Luc finds out that the Theodore in question is actually his son, whom he has not seen for many years. Meanwhile, Monsieur and Madame de la Motte are having their own problems. Pierre de la Motte is on trial for a robbery he committed against the Marquis before he knew who the Marquis was. The Marquis would not have pressed charges if Pierre had helped him kill Adeline. Currently, Monsieur and Madame de la Motte are in Paris, where Pierre is imprisoned and Madame is with him. Adeline, Clara, and Monsieur la Luc travel to Paris to be with Theodore before his execution, unaware of what is happening with the de la Motte's. During Pierre\u2019s trial, witnesses come forward and reveal that the Marquis is not who he claims to be; he had murdered a relative of Adeline and stolen the person\u2019s identity. Because of these developments, Theodore is released from prison, and the Marquis poisons himself after confessing everything. He took this method to avoid being ignominiously killed.

However, these methods struggle to accurately define visual objects. To overcome this, a novel convolutional neural network, CRF-RNN, merges CNNs and CRFs. Specifically, mean-field approximate inference for CRFs with Gaussian pairwise potentials is expressed as Recurrent Neural Networks. This CRF-RNN is integrated into a CNN, creating a deep network leveraging CNN and CRF advantages. This system incorporates CRF modeling into CNNs, enabling end-to-end training via back-propagation, bypassing offline post-processing for object definition. The technique was applied to semantic image segmentation and achieved excellent results on the Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 7039, "text": "This document introduces a new label propagation approach for identifying salient areas in images. The central idea is that image saliency can be found by spreading labels taken from the most reliable background and foreground areas. Many real-world images have boundary superpixels which act as background labels, and the prominence of other superpixels is decided by comparing their similarity to these background labels using an internal propagation process. For intricate images, a three-cue, center-focused objectness measurement is used to select and distribute foreground labels. A co-transduction algorithm combines background and foreground labels using an external propagation method. A compactness standard determines if using foreground labels is needed, thus improving computational speed. Testing on five standard datasets with precise pixel annotations demonstrates that the described technique performs better than current leading methods, according to various assessment standards.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Van Gogh's relatives and famous people were present at the showing of 06/05, a movie concerning Pim Fortuyn's assassination. Van Gogh was murdered in Amsterdam about a month and a half ago. A man with suspected ties to Islamic extremism has been accused. The Netherlands was greatly disturbed by the killing, as well as Fortuyn's death a few years prior. Following the murders, which sparked intense discussion about immigration, many Dutch citizens have doubted their country's image of being peaceful and accepting. An animal rights advocate received an 18-year prison sentence the prior year for Fortuyn's killing. Van Gogh previously released a film that accused Islam of supporting violence against women, which generated anger and death threats. The movie 06/05 will be accessible online soon and in Dutch movie theaters at the start of next year. Van Gogh's film combines actual footage from the day of Fortuyn's killing with a fictional story regarding Dutch intelligence services plotting to silence the politician.

This increase in non-farm payrolls fell short of the anticipated 190,000 new jobs. However, this was sufficient to lower the unemployment rate to 5.2%, the lowest rate since September 2001. These job gains allow President Bush to claim a slight net increase in jobs in the US economy during his initial term. Until last November's presidential election, he had overseen a net decrease in jobs, making him the first president to do so since Herbert Hoover. Consequently, job creation became a central issue in the previous year's election. The combined figures for December and January, however, put the administration's initial term job record in positive territory.\n\nThe Labor Department also announced a downward revision of the job gains for December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\n\nAnalysts suggested the growth in new jobs wasn't as robust as expected, given the positive economic climate.

Jonatan reassures Karl that time differs in Nangijala, making ninety years feel like only a few days. Later, a fire engulfs their house. Jonatan saves Karl by carrying him out the window, but he is mortally wounded. At Jonatan's funeral, the priest calls him \"Jonathan Lionheart\" to acknowledge his bravery. Karl is left alone and questions the reality of Nangijala. A white pigeon appears on his window, which Karl believes confirms its existence. Two months later, Karl passes away from his illness, telling his mother they will meet again in Nangijala. Immediately after death, he is outside a cottage, healthy, and runs to his brother by a river. Jonatan informs him they will live on the Riders farm in the Cherry Valley, where they each have a horse, Grim and Fjalar, and enjoy a time of peace and discovery. They are in Nangijala, a land similar to the Swedish Middle Ages. Karl meets Sofia, whose rose garden Jonatan cares for. He learns there are problems in Nangijala. T\u00f6rnrosdalen (the Thorn Rose Valley), beyond the mountains, is occupied by the evil Tengil, who arrived from Karmanjaka with his men and built a wall. He has enslaved the people of the valley and appears unbeatable with the dragon Katla at his command. Jonatan keeps Katla a secret from Karl, fearing it would frighten him. The people of the Cherry Valley, led by Sofia, support the resistance in the Thorn Rose Valley, but a traitor exists in their village. Sofia's white doves, which carry secret messages, are being shot down. Jonatan leaves for the Thorn Rose Valley to rescue Orvar, the resistance leader imprisoned in the Katla cave, driven by his sense of duty despite the danger. Karl attempts to follow him after a few days. He hides in a cave one night and witnesses two of Tengil's men meeting with the traitor, Jossi the tavernkeeper, who is branded with the \"Katla mark\" to show his allegiance. In the morning, soldiers discover Karl. Suspecting him, they take him to the Thorn Rose Valley. Karl claims he lives with his grandfather, and a man outside a house with a white dove pretends to be his grandfather to protect him. The man, Mattias, is part of the resistance, and Jonatan is inside the house asleep. The brothers reunite. Mattias' house is near the wall, and Tengil's guards are constantly watching for forbidden activities, punishable by death. Jonatan is digging a tunnel under the wall to a forest. Tengil arrives in the Thorn Rose Valley, dressed in black and riding a black horse. He selects men to be slaves in Karmanjaka to build his fort and then be fed to Katla. One man protests, denounces Tengil, and is executed. Jonatan almost completes the tunnel, and the brothers escape. They hide from soldiers while bathing in the river. Jonatan saves a soldier from drowning, showing empathy. At the Karma Falls, Karl sees Katla, a fire-breathing dragon used by Tengil for terror. The next day, they cross the bridge from the Thorn Rose Valley to Karmanjaka. Jonatan finds a second entrance to the Katla cave, where they free Orvar before he can be fed to Katla. They escape back towards the Karma Falls, but soldiers are catching up. Karl jumps off Grim to allow Jonatan and Orvar to escape and plan the rebellion. Karl hides and sees Sofia, Hubert, and Jossi. Karl exposes Jossi as the traitor, and when he is revealed everyone understands. Jossi escapes in a boat but is swept to his death in the waterfall. Shortly after, the people of the Thorn Rose Valley rebel against Tengil, and Jonatan joins despite his vow against taking a life. Orvar criticizes him, but Karl defends him. The battle claims many lives before Tengil arrives with Katla to punish the rebels. Jonatan attacks Tengil and takes the horn used to control Katla. Now free, Katla kills Tengil and his men. Jonatan gains tenuous control over Katla. After the battle, Orvar asks Jonatan to return Katla to the cave, where he will kill her. While crossing the bridge, Grim is frightened, and Jonatan drops the horn into the river. Katla chases them. They hide on a cliff, where Jonatan pushes a rock onto Katla, who falls into the river and fights the lindworm Karm, killing each other. Jonatan explains he was burned by Katla's fire and will soon be paralysed. Jonatan tells Karl about Nangilima, a land of light and happy adventures after Nangijala.

Share values decreased in London and Amsterdam. The UK-based co-chairman, Patrick Cescau, will become group chief executive as part of the restructuring plans. The Dutch co-chairman, Antony Burgmans, will assume the role of non-executive chairman. Mr. Burgmans said that the changes are a natural progression and will provide sharper operational focus. The company will announce the location of its head office, which has been in Rotterdam and London since 1930, at a later time. Shell dismantled its dual-ownership structure last year after experiencing problems related to its oil reserves. An analyst at Petercam said that the structure simplification was the best part of the news. The company stated that the changes will speed up decision-making and that further changes may be made. The business stated that it plans to focus on improving profits, and it plans to accelerate and increase investment in its 400 main brands. Mr. Cescau said that the company let targets limit their flexibility and did not adjust plans quickly enough to a more difficult business environment. The company's objective is to reverse the share loss experienced in some markets in 2004 and return to growth. Unilever reported that European sales decreased by 2.8% last year. Sales of ice cream and frozen food decreased by 3.4%. Revenue in the US grew by 1.5% despite disappointing sales in Slimfast.

{"id": 7076, "text": "Deep, fully convolutional neural networks work well for fast and precise image segmentation. A major hurdle in training these networks is data imbalance, especially in medical imaging like lesion segmentation, where there are fewer lesion voxels than non-lesion voxels. Imbalanced data can cause predictions to favor high precision over recall, which is bad in medicine where missing actual positives is worse than false positives. Solutions include balanced sampling, two-step training, sample re-weighting, and using similarity loss functions. This paper introduces a more general loss function derived from the Tversky index to tackle data imbalance and get a better balance between precision and recall when training 3D fully convolutional networks. Experiments segmenting multiple sclerosis lesions in MRI images showed improvements in the F2 score, Dice coefficient, and precision-recall curve area.

Figures from the UK gaming industry's trade body indicate that gamers spent over \u00a31.34 billion in 2004, which represents an increase of almost 7% compared to 2003. GTA: San Andreas, the year's best-selling title, achieved record sales with players taking on the role of CJ, a character tasked with becoming a crime boss. The game sold over 1 million copies within its first nine days of release. This made it the fastest-selling video game in UK history. Despite its November launch, the sprawling game featuring guns and gangsters outperformed its competition, selling over 1.75 million copies by year's end. Records were also set regarding the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies. Chart-Track data, compiled for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (Elspa), showed that five titles, including Sony EyeToy Play and EA's Need for Speed: Underground 2, accomplished this. Electronic Arts, the world's largest games publisher, had 9 of the top 20 games. According to Elspa director general Roger Bennett, 2004 was a \"stellar year.\" He stated that the market remained strong despite the lack of any new generation console releases, thanks to the industry's maturity and the increasingly diverse range of games attracting new audiences and expanding its player base across different ages and genders. The success of games in 2004 may be attributed to the high number of sequels released that year. Sixteen of the top 20 titles were either follow-ups to existing franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. Titles such as Halo, The Sims, Driver, Need for Speed, Fifa football, and Burnout proved to be as popular as their original counterparts. Doom 3 did not make the top 20, despite the preference for older games. Movie tie-in games also proved successful in 2004. Games based on Shrek, The Incredibles, Spider-Man, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings all made it into the top 20. Elspa reported a 37.9% increase in Xbox game sales during the year. However, Sony's PlayStation 2 remained the top seller, accounting for 47% of the \u00a31.34 billion spent on games in 2004.

The meeting minutes were released much more quickly than normal, only three weeks after the December 14 meeting, suggesting that the Federal Reserve wants to keep the markets better informed of its considerations. This is also being interpreted by some as a sign of future aggressive moves regarding interest rates. During 2004, the main Federal Reserve funds rate increased by 1.25 percentage points from its 46-year low of 1%, which was reached shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), which determines interest rates, suggested that this extended period of low rates \"might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets\". Economists predicted a probable additional increase in rates at the upcoming meeting in early February.

Mr. Wong required the ability to scrutinize extremely small variations to develop mathematical models for researching \"space weather.\" Alternatives such as having a peer explain the maps and attempting to transcribe them into Braille were explored. Mr. Wong ultimately conceived the concept of converting specific colors into musical tones, and he sought the assistance of a computer graphics expert and another student to execute the coding.\n\nMr. Wong informed the BBC News website that the images possess three dimensions, and he needed to find a means of understanding them independently. He believed that creating software to aid blind individuals in interpreting color images would be advantageous for his personal research and for other blind scientists. He experimented with a preliminary version of the software using a parrot photograph. A pen and tablet are used to maintain a precise reference to the display. The software then allocates a piano note out of 88 to each uniquely colored pixel, with lower notes representing blue and higher notes representing red. Mr. Wong acknowledges that the program is still underdeveloped and presently only functional for deciphering digitally generated images. He stated that the software would not effectively identify a randomly scanned image.\n\nMr. Wong, blind since age seven, believes his \"color memory\" enhances the software's utility compared to scientists who have never had sight. He knows that the color becomes more red as the notes increase in pitch, and he imagines a red patch. The color-to-music program is not yet commercially available, and Mr. Wong suggests that collective effort is needed to render it practical.

{"id": 7091, "text": "The chairman of the US stock market regulator stated he is open to relaxing strict new US rules for corporations to lessen the burden on companies based outside the US. During a speech in London, William Donaldson indicated upcoming \"initiatives\". European companies have complained that US laws enacted following the Enron scandal make listing on Wall Street too expensive. The US regulator suggested foreign companies might receive more time to adhere to a critical part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Act is scheduled to be enforced in mid-2005. It requires all companies listed on the US stock market to submit declarations, which critics contend will significantly increase the expense of preparing their yearly reports. Companies that violate the new law could face substantial penalties, while top executives risk prison sentences of up to 20 years. Mr. Donaldson commented that while the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements\". There is widespread agreement regarding the Act's objectives, which mandate chief executives to sign a statement assuming responsibility for the accuracy of financial reports. However, European companies with secondary listings in New York have voiced objections, asserting that the costs of compliance outweigh the advantages of a dual listing. The Act also applies to companies with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation that many companies without US listings could encounter. The 300-shareholder threshold has caused frustration because it essentially prevents the most straightforward solution, delisting. Mr. Donaldson stated that the SEC would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign companies unwilling to meet US requirements. He said, \"We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections\" without making the US market \"one with no exit.\" He revealed that his staff were already assessing the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act's most unpopular measure - Section 404 - for foreign companies. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 requires chief executives to take responsibility for the company's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already postponed the implementation of this clause for smaller companies - including US ones - with market capitalizations below $700m (\u00a3374m). According to the Financial Times, a group of European companies visited the SEC in December to advocate for changes. It was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UK's Confederation of British Industry (CBI), and included representatives from BASF, Siemens, and Cadbury Schweppes. It is believed that compliance costs are already making companies hesitant about US listings. Air China chose the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (\u00a3558m) stock market debut last month. Additionally, there are rumors that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead, press reports in China suggest that the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The singer's sister contradicts the widow, saying he was working on his own album. Suspicious, the obituary writer visits the corpse and finds no autopsy was performed. Before he can request one, the body is cremated.\n\nOnce an investigative reporter, he was demoted after insulting the newspaper's CEO and hopes to return to the front page by covering a famous person's death.

Later, a burglar attacks him in his apartment with a frozen lizard corpse, leaving him unconscious. Two detectives inform him the keyboardist was murdered. With his apartment trashed, he stays with his editor. They search the boat where he interviewed the keyboardist and find a hidden hard drive.\n\nHe is upset to learn his ex-girlfriend is remarrying.

Arriving in New York, the family stays with Winston and Grace, relatives of Kitty\u2019s mother. Boy finds work driving a laundry truck, and Kitty works in the office of his employer. Kitty, frustrated by racism, inserts messages like \u201cMarcus Garvey was right\u201d into the linens delivered to white customers. Kitty then takes Clare\u2019s younger sister Jennie and returns to Jamaica. Clare becomes increasingly lonely after her mother and sister leave, as she hasn't started school and isn't allowed to leave the house alone. She watches movies and remembers her first American encounter: a white teacher in Jamaica who taught about the Civil War, showed the film Gone With the Wind, and praised racial hierarchies. Upon starting school, Clare is told she will be held back due to the differing development of children from Third World countries, despite her intelligence. Boy attempts to prove Clare is white, but the school does not believe him and has no \u201cbi-racial\u201d category. Five years later, Kitty lives in Jamaica with Jennie. Clare, now a college sophomore, finds her father crying one evening. He tells her that her mother has died and that Jennie will be coming to live with them. After Jennie moves in, Clare borrows money from her uncle Fredrick and goes to England. Clare arrives in London, finds a room, and explores the city by visiting museums and bookstores. Eventually, she becomes a legal resident and enrolls at the University of London to study art history. After some time, Clare accepts her uncle\u2019s invitation to return to Jamaica, where she attends the same party as Paul H. and meets Harry/Harriet. Clare and Harry/Harriet become friends in Kingston, Jamaica, spending time together discussing Jamaican history and society. They stay in touch after Clare returns to England. Back in England, Clare is disturbed by a National Front march and the racism at her college. Her attempts to explain her feelings to her friend Liz are unsuccessful, leaving her isolated. Later, Clare meets Bobby, a Vietnam War veteran with a persistent wound. They travel around Europe together. While traveling, Clare receives a letter from Harry/Harriet stating that her aunt and uncle are moving to Miami, leaving her grandmother's farm to her. Clare continues to travel with Bobby, who is still struggling with the war's effects, until he disappears. Clare waits for Bobby but ultimately decides to return to Jamaica. Upon her return, Clare becomes ill and discovers she has a womb infection that will likely cause sterility. After recovering, Harry/Harriet suggests they travel to Clare\u2019s grandmother\u2019s farm. There, Clare and Harry/Harriet bathe in the river where she used to bathe as a child for the first time in twenty years. Chapter nine reveals that Christopher was never arrested and now wanders Kingston's ghettos. Known as the Watchman of Kingston, he becomes a subject of a reggae song. During a fire where many old women die, Christopher appears, shouting prophecies. After visiting the countryside, Clare becomes aware of Jamaica\u2019s difficult economic conditions. Harry/Harriet then takes her to a tenement room in Kingston, where she joins a clandestine revolutionary group. She is interrogated about her motives and convinces them of her commitment to revolution for the poor and oppressed in Jamaica. Clare connects her life experiences to Jamaica\u2019s oppressed condition as a former colony and part of the Third World. Finally, Clare recalls her mother\u2019s final wish for her to help her people, which becomes her ultimate justification for joining the revolutionaries. In the book's final chapter, a film crew arrives in Jamaica to make a movie about the Maroons, hiring Christopher, \u201cde Watchman,\u201d for a small part. Clare and the revolutionaries plan to attack the crew, but it becomes clear that they have been betrayed, and tragedy occurs.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Accurate image segmentation is key for evaluating bone metastasis response, but anatomical region segmentation in QBSPECT images often depends on manual expert input due to image limitations. A quick, reliable automated segmentation method is introduced to divide a QBSPECT image into lesion, bone, and background. A novel unsupervised segmentation loss function, along with semi- and supervised versions, is presented for training a ConvNet. These loss functions are based on the FCM algorithm's objective function. A thorough comparison was performed against ConvNets trained with supervised loss functions and standard clustering techniques. Metrics like the DSC were used to evaluate lesion and bone delineation in simulated and clinical SPECT/CT images. Experiments showed that the new methods produced good segmentation on clinical data, even with training on realistic simulated images. A ConvNet-based image segmentation approach utilizing new loss functions was created and tested. The method is adaptable to unsupervised, semi-supervised, or fully-supervised modes depending on the availability of labeled training data. Results showed that the method offers rapid and consistent lesion and bone segmentation for QBSPECT/CT and could be useful for other medical image segmentation tasks.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 7115, "text": "In a made-up beach town called Amity, found on Long Island, New York, a young vacationer named Chrissie Watkins goes swimming and is killed by a large great white shark. When the police find her body, the cause of death is apparent. Police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches, but mayor Larry Vaughan and other town leaders disagree because they don't want to hurt the town's tourist economy. The local newspaper editor, Harry Meadows, helps to hide the attack. After a few days, the shark kills a young boy and an old man close to the shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is hired to kill the shark, but he disappears. Brody and his deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's empty boat with bite marks. Hendricks finds a big shark tooth in one of the holes. Brody feels responsible and wants to close the beaches again. He asks Meadows to investigate Vaughan's business connections to find out why he is so eager to keep the beaches open. Meadows finds out that Vaughan is connected to the Mafia, who want to protect their real estate investments in Amity. Meadows also brings in Matt Hooper, an expert on sharks from the Woods Hole Institute, to help. Brody's wife, Ellen, is unhappy with her life and misses her old wealthy lifestyle. She becomes friends with Hooper, especially after learning he is the brother of a man she used to date. They have a brief affair at a motel. Brody suspects the affair. With the beaches still open, people come to town hoping to see the shark. Brody, feeling guilty, sets up patrols on the beach and in the water. After a boy is almost attacked by the shark, Brody closes the beaches and hires Quint, a professional shark hunter, to kill the shark. Brody, Quint, and Hooper go out on Quint's boat, the Orca. They struggle with each other and the shark. Hooper is upset by Quint's methods, including cutting open a blue shark and using an illegally-caught baby dolphin as bait. Quint makes fun of Hooper for not shooting at beer cans. Brody and Hooper argue, and Brody suspects Hooper is having an affair with Ellen. He even tries to strangle Hooper. After two unproductive days at sea, they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper shows Brody and Quint a shark-proof cage from Woods Hole. Quint initially refuses to allow the cage on the boat, but he agrees when Hooper offers him more money. Out on the ocean, after Quint fails to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage to try to kill it with a bang stick. He is captivated by the shark and wants to take pictures first. However, the shark attacks the cage, breaks it apart, and kills him. Brody is discouraged and realizes there is no more money to pay Quint, but Quint is now determined to kill the shark regardless of payment. Meanwhile, Larry Vaughan tells Ellen that he and his wife are leaving Amity, and he reveals to Ellen that he always thought they would've made a great couple. The next day, the shark rams the boat, and Quint harpoons it three times. The shark jumps onto the boat, and it starts to sink. Quint harpoons the shark again, but his foot gets caught in the rope, and he drowns when the shark drags him under.

{"id": 7116, "text": "The book takes the form of a journal supposedly penned by Zeno, who suggests the writing is untruthful, and it is published by his physician. The doctor includes an introductory note explaining that he had Zeno compose the autobiography as a component of his psychoanalysis. The doctor released the writing as retribution for Zeno ending his therapy sessions. The journal lacks a sequential timeline, opting instead for thematic chapters, such as those addressing smoking, his father's passing, and his marriage. The final section deviates, existing as a true diary with entries tied to specific dates during World War I. Zeno begins by recounting his nicotine dependency, recalling early smoking experiences. He remembers his childhood. A friend purchased cigarettes for his brother and him. Soon, he feels compelled to steal funds from his father to acquire tobacco, but ultimately refrains from doing so due to guilt. He then resorts to smoking his father's partially smoked cigars instead. His \"last cigarette\" fixation emerges at age twenty, coinciding with a fever and his doctor's advice to cease smoking for recovery. He resolves to quit, smoking a \"last cigarette\" as a symbol, but it's never truly his last, and he becomes trapped in a cycle of \"last cigarettes.\" He attempts to quit on significant life dates and on harmonizing numeric dates. Each attempt to quit smoking fails. He seeks help from doctors and friends without success. He even admits himself to a clinic, but he flees. As Zeno ages, his father's health declines. He moves closer to his father as a precaution. Zeno and his father are polar opposites; the former is playful, the latter is serious. For example, after his father calls him insane, Zeno obtains a medical certificate proving his sanity, which he shows his father, who is hurt by the prank and even more convinced that Zeno is insane. His father fears death and is uncomfortable creating his will. One evening, his father becomes seriously ill and unconscious. The doctor intervenes, temporarily reviving him. Over the next few days, his father recovers somewhat. He is restless and shifts positions for comfort often, even though the doctor says that staying in bed would be good for his circulation. One night, as his father attempts to get out of bed, Zeno, acting on the doctor's advice, restrains him. In anger, his father stands up and accidentally slaps Zeno before dying. The narrative then shifts to Zeno's courtship and marriage. While entering the business world, he meets Giovanni Malfenti, his future father-in-law, a successful and intelligent businessman whom Zeno admires. Malfenti has four daughters\u2014Ada, Augusta, Alberta, and Anna\u2014and Zeno decides to pursue Ada because of her beauty and because Alberta is quite young, while he regards Augusta as too plain, and Anna is only a little girl. His efforts are unsuccessful, with the Malfenti family assuming he is interested in Augusta. Soon after, he meets Guido Speier, Ada's suitor. Guido speaks perfect Tuscan (in contrast to Zeno's Trieste dialect), is attractive, and has a full head of hair (unlike Zeno's baldness). One evening, during a visit with the Malfentis, Zeno proposes to Ada, who rejects him in favor of Guido. He then proposes to Alberta, who has no interest in marriage, and is rejected by her as well. Finally, he proposes to Augusta (who knows that Zeno proposed to the other two), and she accepts, due to her love for him. Shortly after their marriage, Zeno discovers he can love Augusta, much to his surprise. However, he embarks on an affair with Carla, a struggling singer, who believes Zeno does not love his wife. Meanwhile, Ada and Guido get married and Mr. Malfenti becomes ill. Zeno's affection grows for both Augusta and Carla. Around the time Giovanni dies, he has a daughter named Antonia. Then, one day, Carla abruptly wants to meet Augusta. Zeno deceives Carla, leading her to meet Ada instead. Carla mistakes Ada for Zeno's wife and ends the affair. Zeno then recounts his business partnership with Guido. They start a merchant business together in Trieste. They hire two workers named Luciano and Carmen (who becomes Guido's mistress) and they try to make as much money as possible. Guido's obsession with debt, credit, and profit leads to the company's failure. Ada and Guido's marriage crumbles, as does Ada's health and beauty. Guido fakes a suicide attempt to gain Ada's compassion, and she enlists Zeno's help to save Guido's failing business. Guido starts playing on the Bourse (stock exchange) and loses even more money. On a fishing trip, he asks Zeno about the differences in effects between sodium veronal and veronal and Zeno answers that sodium veronal is fatal while veronal is not. Guido's gambling worsens and he attempts another fake suicide, taking a fatal dose of veronal and dying. Soon after, Zeno misses Guido's funeral because he gambles Guido's money on the Bourse and recovers three quarters of the losses. Zeno details his present life during World War I, with his daughter Antonia (resembling Ada) and son Alfio now grown. He spends time visiting doctors, seeking a cure for his perceived illnesses. One doctor claims he has an Oedipus complex, which Zeno dismisses. All the doctors fail to treat him. Ultimately, he concludes that life itself is akin to sickness, with its advancements, setbacks, and inevitable end in death. Human advancement has provided mankind not more able bodies, but weapons that can be sold, bought, stolen to prolong life. This deviation from natural selection causes more sickness and weakness in humans. Zeno envisions a time when someone will invent a weapon of mass destruction and another will steal it to destroy the world, freeing it from sickness.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The popularity of portable music players is considered the reason for this growth. The accessibility and growth of online music services are expected to further propel the trend toward portable music players.\n\nSome people are starting to use portable music players in new ways, like using syncing functions to share DIY radio shows, or podcasts. Competition from mobile phone operators who want to offer streaming services on more advanced phones is expected to increase in 2005. Research suggests that people want to build large music collections, which is possible with high-capacity storage devices like iPods. While mobile phones do not have this capacity yet, and have issues with portability, Apple is addressing the mobile music market by working with Motorola to create an iTunes version for their phones.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The figures from the Labor Department, a positive development for President Bush following his re-election, followed a period of limited job growth during the summer. Job creation occurred across all sectors of the US economy except for manufacturing. The separate rate of unemployment increased from 5.4% in September to 5.5%, which was due to an increased number of individuals actively looking for employment. The 337,000 new jobs created in October was double the 169,000 that Wall Street economists had anticipated. Furthermore, the Labor Department adjusted upwards the figures for job creation in the previous two months, with September\u2019s revised figure being 139,000 instead of 96,000, and August's being 198,000 instead of 128,000. The stronger than expected jobs figures immediately pushed stocks higher in New York, with the Dow Jones index increasing by 45.4 points to reach 10,360 by late morning. One economist stated that the improving jobs picture suggested support for consumer spending during the holidays, which would compensate for the negative impact of elevated oil prices. Further analysts suggested the positive employment figures increased the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% during their next meeting. An economist commented that this should give the Fed more confidence to take action. The commissioner of the Bureau of Labor stated that much of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October related to rebuilding and clean-up efforts in Florida and nearby southern states after four hurricanes in August and September.

This efficiency enables the exploration of more advanced architectures for structured prediction in deep learning, including multi-resolution architectures for coupling information across different scales within a joint optimization framework, resulting in improvements. The approach is validated on the VOC PASCAL 2012 image segmentation benchmark, achieving significant improvements compared to established baselines.

Standard backpropagation methods are used to learn the feature spaces for bilateral filtering, along with other module parameters, from start to finish. The bilateral inception component tackles two problems that arise with standard CNN segmentation structures. Firstly, the module communicates information between (super) pixels while acknowledging image edges, using the problem's structured information to enhance outcomes. Secondly, the layer retrieves a full-resolution segmentation outcome from a CNN's lower-resolution result. In experiments, existing CNN structures are modified by inserting the inception module between the CNN's final (1x1 convolution) layers.

{"id": 7172, "text": "Updated regulations are being implemented concerning matrimony for foreign citizens residing in the UK.\n\nStarting Tuesday, most individuals who are not citizens of EU countries will need authorization from the Home Office to get married. The Home Office states the updated regulations are intended to decrease the quantity of fraudulent marriages, which they estimate happen up to 15,000 times yearly. However, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), an immigrants' organization, asserts the regulations violate human rights legislation and may initiate a legal challenge. When the modifications were revealed the previous year, immigration minister Des Browne stated: \"Our objective is to prevent unnecessary disturbances of legitimate marriages, while implementing robust controls to prevent misuse.\" Under the previous regulations, any individual wishing to get married in the UK only needed to offer evidence they had been a resident in the country for a week and give 15 days' notice of the wedding at the local register office.\n\nHowever, starting Tuesday, all non-EU citizens, except citizens of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland, or Norway, intending to marry in the UK must either acquire a visa permitting them to get married prior to entering the country or make an application for a 'certificate of marriage approval' from the Home Office. To acquire a certificate, which costs \u00a3135, applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the UK. Those without a settled status, such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application, will not have a right to marry in the UK.\n\nOnce they have the required documentation, those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in England or Wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. They can, however, marry at the register office or church of their choice. Rhian Beynon of the JCWI stated the updated regulations were \"not proportionate\" and \"discriminatory\".\n\n\"These rules mean in some cases the Home Secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort. \"We're currently taking a legal opinion on this. We'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the Human Rights Court,\" Ms Beynon stated. The parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has also questioned the updated regulations. In a report published last July, the cross-party committee stated there was a \"significant risk\" the updated procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions that were \"disproportionate.\" The report added that the committee believed the updated laws might be incompatible with the Human Rights Act on the grounds of religion, belief, and nationality.\n\nOver the last year, immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been increased, resulting in an increasing number of convictions. In January, 25 individuals who took part in a fraudulent marriage network based in Leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. And last November, Samuel Amoah, a Belgian national who established two fraudulent weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the UK, was jailed for three years. Several other cases are currently going through the courts. The role of registrars, who under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 were obligated to report suspected fraudulent marriages to the Home Office, has been key in many prosecutions. Mark Rimmer, a spokesperson for registrars, stated they welcomed the updated marriage regulations and believed they would be a significant deterrent. \"They will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. Certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married,\" Mr. Rimmer stated. Mr. Rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at Brent Council in north-west London, stated he did not consider the updated law to be an infringement of civil liberties. \"It may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it's still not as difficult to marry in the UK than it is to marry, for example, in Holland, Germany or France. \"I think it's a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem,\" Mr. Rimmer stated.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This SegAN system is presented as more effective and stable for segmentation and as delivering superior performance to the U-net segmentation method. SegAN was evaluated on datasets from the MICCAI BRATS challenge for segmenting brain tumors. The SegAN with multi-scale loss results show that SegAN provides results similar to current methods for segmenting the entire tumor and tumor core on BRATS 2013, while improving precision and sensitivity for Gd-enhanced tumor core segmentation; SegAN surpasses other methods in both dice score and precision on BRATS 2015.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 7188, "text": "Blankets is a story about Craig Thompson growing up, his connection with his younger brother when they were kids, and his struggles with both his faith and his initial romantic feelings. The author tells the story in order but uses memories of the past to link his character's present as a young man with his earlier years. Some significant topics explored are falling in love for the first time, sexuality in both children and adults, religion, family relationships between siblings, and the journey of becoming an adult. The story starts by portraying the main character's bond with his brother in their Wisconsin childhood. Even though they often fought like siblings do, they were also very supportive of each other, which helped them endure being mistreated by their overly devout parents, as well as being harassed and assaulted at school. During his preteen years, Thompson is an outcast because of how he looks and the environment he grew up in. As a teenager, he still has trouble fitting in, but at a Bible camp one winter, he finds a group of teens he thinks he can relate to, including Raina, a fascinating girl who enchants him. They quickly become close and plan to spend two weeks together at Raina's home in Michigan. There, he meets Raina's family, which includes her divorced parents, her adopted brother and sister, her biological sister, and her baby niece. Because her sister is developmentally delayed and her niece is neglected by her parents, Raina feels obligated to care for them. Even though she and Craig are very close while he's visiting, she believes she can't handle any more responsibilities and ends their relationship shortly after he departs. He then gets rid of everything she ever gave him and every reminder of their time together, except for the blanket she made for him. He puts it and other items in the attic and leaves home to start his own life somewhere else. Away from his family, Thompson reconciles with his religion and his spiritual identity. After a number of years, he goes back to his childhood home, seemingly a changed person. He rebuilds his relationships with his family, and they grow closer. The story concludes with him finding contentment with himself and his loved ones.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Current SSL algorithms often regularize model training through network or data manipulation. This work explores whether explicit task-level regularization, rather than implicit network/data perturbation, can be built for SSL, considering that multi/dual-task learning addresses varying information levels with inherent prediction perturbation. A novel dual-task-consistency semi-supervised framework is introduced, using a dual-task deep network to jointly predict a pixel-wise segmentation map and a geometry-aware level set representation. The level set representation is transformed into an approximate segmentation map via a differentiable task transform layer. Dual-task consistency regularization is applied between the level set-derived segmentation maps and directly predicted segmentation maps for both labeled and unlabeled data. Experiments demonstrate improved performance by incorporating unlabeled data and outperforming current semi-supervised methods.

The shift demonstrates the increasing economic power of China. Japan's imports from and exports to China (including Hong Kong) in 2004 totaled 22,201 billion yen ($214.6 billion;\u00a3114.5 billion). This was the largest amount of trade between the two countries since 1947, compared to 20,479.5 billion yen with the US. One-time occurrences negatively impacted trade with the US in 2004, such as the 13-month prohibition on American beef imports after a cow in the US was discovered to have bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Economists forecast that China will become an even more vital trade partner for Japan in the future. Data released on Tuesday revealed that the Chinese economy expanded by 9.5% in 2004, and specialists believe that general growth prospects remain robust.

{"id": 7216, "text": "The book tells its story through three separate but intertwined perspectives. One follows a Dominican woman named Urania Cabral. A second examines the individuals who plotted against Trujillo. The third explores the figure of Trujillo himself. The narrative shifts between these three strands, and it moves between the years 1961 and 1996, and also includes flashbacks to earlier periods of Trujillo's rule. The novel starts with Urania's return to Santo Domingo, previously named Ciudad Trujillo. This part of the story is very personal, covering Urania's reflections and her unresolved feelings surrounding her departure from the Dominican Republic thirty-five years earlier. Urania left the crumbling Trujillo regime in 1961, under the guise of studying with nuns in Michigan. In the decades that followed, she becomes a well-known and accomplished lawyer in New York. She eventually goes back to the Dominican Republic in 1996 and feels the need to deal with her father and aspects of her past she has avoided. As Urania talks to her ailing father, Agustin Cabral, she remembers more and more of the anger and resentment that caused her thirty-five years of silence. Urania recounts her father's fall from political favor, and the act of betrayal that is central to both her story and Trujillo's. The second and third parts of the story take place in 1961, in the weeks before and after Trujillo's assassination on May 30th. Each assassin has a personal history, explaining why they were involved in the assassination plot. Each of them has been wronged by Trujillo and his regime, through torture and brutality, or through attacks on their honor, their religion, their morals, or their loved ones. Vargas Llosa tells the story of these men through memories recalled on the night of Trujillo's death, as the conspirators wait for \"The Goat\". Interwoven with these stories are the actions of other well-known Trujillo supporters of the time, including Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, Johnny Abbes Garc\u00eda, and others, some real, some fictionalized composites, and some purely made up. The third part of the story deals with the thoughts and motivations of Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo Molina himself. The sections about The Goat recall key events of his time, such as the massacre of thousands of Dominican Haitians in 1937. They also deal with the Dominican Republic's difficult international relationships during the Cold War, particularly with the United States under John F. Kennedy, and Cuba under Castro. Vargas Llosa also considers Trujillo's inner thoughts and depicts a man whose physical condition is failing. Trujillo is bothered by incontinence and impotence, and this part of the story connects with Urania's when it is revealed that Trujillo sexually assaulted Urania. He is unable to get an erection with Urania, and in frustration and anger he rapes her with his hands. This event is the foundation of Urania's shame, and her hatred of her father. Furthermore, it is the cause of Trujillo's repeated anger over the \"anemic little bitch\" that witnessed his impotence and emotion, and the reason he is on his way to sleep with another girl on the night he is killed. In the novel's final chapters, the three storylines come together more and more often. The tone of these chapters is especially dark, as they deal mainly with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of the SIM, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the deals made with Trujillo's most ruthless supporters, allowing them to take their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then leave the country. The book concludes with Urania preparing to return home, determined to stay in touch with her family on the island this time.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The research shows that with few training examples, logit activation distributions shift towards or beyond the decision boundary for under-represented classes in unseen test samples, with over-represented classes remaining stable. Foreground samples are often under-represented in image segmentation. The study finds that overfitting decreases sensitivity, but precision is stable.

This is accomplished through weak and semi-supervised learning using varied datasets. A neural network is initially trained on a large image dataset with image-level labels to learn visual-semantic embeddings across many concepts. Next, the embedding network is refined and broadened to forecast attention maps, using a dataset with bounding box labels.

The TSLFN utilizes two separate deep pathways followed by a fusion network. This design is based on the idea that user interactions provide more focused foreground/background information than the image alone; the two-branch structure minimizes the layers between user interaction features and the output, giving user interactions a stronger influence on the segmentation. The MSRN combines features from various layers of the TSLFN at different scales to capture both local and global foreground details for refining the segmentation at the original resolution. The network's performance was evaluated on four standard datasets through extensive testing.

This makes the image translation process free from reliance on features related to locality, overall structure, content, or style. Our model includes a bidirectional reconstruction component enhanced with an affine transform, which aids in preserving content and realism better than other models. A key benefit is that the image translation is semi-supervised, doesn't require image segmentation, and leverages the realistic image generation capabilities of generative adversarial networks. Our method yields improved results compared to Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-image translation.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 7250, "text": "The story opens with Julia nearing death from starvation, under the control of her stepbrother, Tiberius, and deciding to record her life's events. Julia's character is established from her birth at a time when war with Ptolemaic Egypt is imminent. She is portrayed as a rebellious, strong-willed child, yet possessing kindness and empathy for the Roman people. Her political views share republican ideals with her father, but she leans towards a more open-minded approach to Rome's governance. She is adored by almost everyone, with the exception of her stepmother, Livia. Julia remains loyal to her father while still being unafraid to challenge his choices. Growing up amidst schemes and political plays, Julia eventually falls victim to them. Under the influence of her mother, Scribonia, and the poets Horace and Ovid, she begins to find joy in her life. Her only true companion is her slave and later freedwoman, Phoebe. As a child, she learns from a cousin that her father and Livia do not have a real marriage, with Livia seeking other women. This revelation causes Julia to lose respect for her father. At thirteen, she is almost seduced by Calpurnius Piso, who develops strong feelings for her. However, his advances are thwarted when Julia is married at fourteen to her cousin Marcellus, on whom she has a slight infatuation. Yet, Marcellus is unable to consummate the marriage. Julia faces constant humiliation from other women who mock her for her inability to conceive and for being unable to disclose her virginity. When Marcellus dies a few years later from illness, Julia takes the blame for his death, despite not being at fault. Following Marcellus' death, she is engaged to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a man more than twice her age. Julia confides in Agrippa about her unconsummated marriage to Marcellus, making him promise to keep it a secret. Though initially resistant to the marriage, Julia grows to love Agrippa. She marries Agrippa and quickly becomes pregnant, giving birth to their son Gaius nine months later. Upon Agrippa's return, she becomes pregnant again with their daughter Vipsania Julia. Around the time of her third pregnancy, Augustus introduces laws against adultery and requiring couples to have at least three children to receive certain benefits. Julia and Agrippa, along with others like Scribonia, meet the requirements, while some of Julia's friends, including Horace, do not. Julia protests Augustus' renewed laws on behalf of her friends. Upon the birth of her son Lucius, Augustus tries to adopt Gaius and Lucius, so that both he and Livia will be in line with the new law, but Julia resists, suggesting he have his own two additional children. Soon after, Julia gives birth to her daughter Agrippina. Julia befriends Aemilia and her husband Lucius Vinicius after a meeting where Julia is worshiped as Diana. She also spends time with her cousins Claudia Marcella and Iullus Antonius, the son of Mark Antony. Julia attempts to help Tiberius, Agrippa's eldest daughter Vipsania's husband, with his low self-esteem by watching his cavalry practice. Around this time, Scribonia uncovers details about Augustus' affairs, which are leaked through Julia. To counter the rumours, Tiberius starts a rumour that Julia had a passion for him, and Iullus spreads the rumour out of jealousy. Scribonia advises Julia to avoid Tiberius to combat the rumours. She then tells Agrippa about Tiberius' claims, and he believes her. Julia becomes pregnant with her fifth child, but Agrippa catches a fever. Due to her pregnancy, Julia cannot be with him, and he dies. Julia is heartbroken. She begins to call the baby Agrippa's name and, upon his birth, names him Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Postumus, cherishing him above her other children because of his resemblance to his father. After Agrippa's death, Augustus forces Julia to allow him to adopt Gaius and Lucius, but she refuses to let him have Postumus. Augustus also compels Julia to marry Tiberius, who must divorce his wife to do so. Augustus sends Tiberius away on a campaign to keep them apart. Soon after the marriage, Julia is visited by Octavia, who reveals Livia's plan to have Julia marry Tiberius so he might become emperor. Octavia passes away soon after. Iullus Antonius also becomes Julia's close friend and discloses his opposition to the marriage because he believed it threatened Gaius and Lucius' claim to the throne. He confesses his love for Julia, admitting that his protests against her marriage to Tiberius stemmed from his desire to marry her himself and that he had urged Augustus to let him marry her instead. He expresses his wish for Gaius to succeed Augustus and his desire to marry Julia. Julia realizes he only befriended her to become her lover and sends him away, but Iullus promises that if Tiberius were to die, she would let him marry her. After this encounter, Iullus begins to pursue Julia by sending her love letters, gifts, and other expressions of affection. Although Julia is also attracted to him, she resists the temptation for fear of becoming pregnant while Tiberius is away. Tiberius returns from his campaign after two years, and despite Julia's attempts to be kind, he treats her with coldness because he has heard of Iullus' feelings for her. Tiberius constantly insults Julia and hysterically blames her for his divorce from Vipsania. Julia realizes her husband is mentally unstable and recognizes his cruelty when he brutally rapes her upon his return. Julia is crushed by her situation, and Tiberius's cruelty leads her to give in to Iullus, starting an affair. They hide their relationship under the guise of her pregnancy, meeting secretly at friends' homes. Iullus helps Julia promote her sons to the people of Rome. They begin to favour the boys and Iullus over Tiberius. Julia gives birth to Tiberius's son, but he passes away a few weeks after being born. After some time, Tiberius can no longer tolerate Julia siding with Iullus and decides to leave Rome. When Julia requests a divorce, Augustus refuses because it would sever his connection with the Claudian family. Desperate to marry Julia and secure the boys' place in the succession, Iullus plans to murder Tiberius while he is away, as Tiberius's death would leave Augustus with no one but Iullus, removing the Claudians from the picture. When Iullus tells Julia about the plan, she refuses to help or support him. Shortly after this, Julia and her friends are arrested for adultery. She is also charged with treason against the emperor, not for attempting to murder Tiberius but Augustus. Despite Julia's denials, Augustus becomes enraged and demands that she be exiled or executed. Iullus Antonius and others are arrested, including Julia's brother Cornelius. While her friends are exiled, Iullus is forced to write a confession before being executed. He admits to committing adultery with Julia but claims she knew nothing of his plans, taking responsibility to save her from execution. He commits suicide to avoid execution and further questioning. Rumours begin to spread that Augustus has lost his mind and that Julia has started another civil war, taking the role of Cleopatra, with Iullus as Mark Antony. When Phoebe is imprisoned and threatened with torture, she commits suicide to protect Julia and Iullus' affair. Scribonia saves Julia from execution by visiting Augustus and threatening a public uprising if he takes such action. He agrees to only exile her and allows Scribonia to accompany her. Julia concludes her story by describing her confinement and refusal to eat. The novel ends with a bittersweet and satisfying conclusion.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Edison states that he has invited Alicia to his Menlo Park residence to initiate the process and explains to Ewald how their interactions will feel natural. Ewald then inquires about the reasons behind Hadaly's creation. Edison recounts the story of Mr. Edward Anderson, who was led to infidelity by a young woman named Miss Evelyn, an act of deception that ruined his life. Edison discovered that Miss Evelyn's beauty was artificial, relying on cosmetics and accessories. Driven by this, Edison sought to create a perfect, natural woman through Hadaly, free from the flaws and artifice of real women. Edison elaborates on Hadaly's mechanical functioning for Ewald, covering her movements, speech, breathing, and hygiene, while drawing parallels to human actions and needs.

Numerous things will be forever altered, exceeding initial expectations. As war's fury commences destruction, it endangers the very freedoms it seeks to defend. War stands as humanity's most significant affliction, surpassing religion, politics, and sanity. Any tribulation is preferable to that which incapacitates humanity. Upon the outbreak of war, borders shift, and all casualties become symbols of the rage that must play out before peace talks can begin.\n\nOur vessel departed before sunrise, enveloped in dense fog, with our destination and the captain's intentions unknown. It soon became clear that this was not a pleasure voyage but a stark experience with no escape. Traveling at twenty knots, we were accompanied by ten thousand young Americans en route to Europe to face death. A sailor assured us of eventual mail delivery, with Uncle Sam ensuring it no matter how far we ventured. Thirty feet below deck, in the ship's depths, I sought sleep, creating a space prone to claustrophobia. My life vest was always worn, as a precaution against German submarines or underwater explosives. We spent thirty-three days at sea, crossing the equator twice, marking years of past sacrifice.\n\nOn Sunday, December seventh, 1941, as most of Hawaii slept, Japanese planes arrived. Waves of fighters and bombers flew from Japanese ships, while our aircraft remained grounded, accompanied by Japanese war cries. The winds of war had been blowing across the earth, but it wasn't until Pearl Harbor was attacked that we understood freedom's value. Wars are fought and won on both domestic and battlefront levels, each being essential when war controls our emotions. The assault led to World War II, with death, sorrow, and separation. All who served were aware of their sacrifices for the nation.\n\nD-Day initiated the conflict that suggested the end of Hitler's ambition. It was the most extensive joint combat landing ever, even though both sides bled severely. As their ships hit the beach, the ramps were lowered, and everyone aboard encountered hell. They stepped out to serve their nation, intending to kill the enemy without hesitation. They combatted Germans, tides, wind, and waves, under unforeseen conditions. By nightfall, the battle favored our side, marked by bravery, valor, death, and men's screams. The beach was covered with bodies for five miles, but bravery had triumphed, with thousands either dead or injured, and the survivors resolved to stay. They faced overwhelming odds and refused to back down, thereby winning the war that embarrassed evil. Most returned home, married, and had children, but we mourn those who didn't.\n\nIt was June 4th, 1942, and I was floating alone in the sea; the ship I was on had sunk, and I believed I would never see my home again. The Japanese fleet had approached from the east, planning to take Midway. However, American warships stopped them, and their guns, bombs, and torpedo planes were responsible for saving the day. All night, I watched the fireworks of war, and on the second day, we stepped up the attack. Big bombers from Hawaii dropped their loads on Japanese ships that quickly chose to retreat. An imperial pilot, injured by sea creatures, floated nearby. I couldn't help but feel compassion for this man who had answered the call, just like me. After the battle, I was rescued from the ocean's depths by men in a lifeboat just after dawn. I had observed the Battle of Midway for two days; now, the battle had ceased and the enemy was gone.\n\nOkinawa was to be our last stop before invading Japan. It was the most significant landing of the Pacific War, as our soldiers rushed across the sand. Initially, our marines were hardly opposed, but on the fifth day, they encountered hell. They found a massive wall of human resistance, as weapons fired from caves. Air power and large guns had little impact on their cliff forts carved deep into the limestone. It took hand-to-hand combat to drive them out, as flying bullets pierced flesh and bone. Kamikaze pilots crashed their planes, knocking out transports and warships. As the Imperial air force attacked our fleet, cries of fear and hate spewed from lips. One hundred and ten thousand Japanese were killed by the end of the battle. Over twelve thousand Americans died before our flag flew over the field.\n\nAfter France fell in 1940, the Germans quickly started their own blockade, primarily targeting the Atlantic, hoping to disrupt Britain's war trade. With fast surface raiders like the Bismarck, merchant ships at sea had little chance. The German's small navy sank ship after ship, until the British Navy stopped war's romance. Shipping losses from German U-boats rose, and the Battle of the Atlantic seemed lost. However, America would soon join the war to defeat freedom's enemies at all costs. Multitudes would die, and their families would mourn, before World War II concluded. What a waste of humanity, who had lost its mind, although now, our enemy is our friend.\n\nWhen you become a P.O.W., you lose your freedom and more; the guard with the gun tells you what to do, as you long for the freedoms you once had. Your will to serve keeps you alive, though at times you wish you were dead. Tortures are far beyond any normal understanding, and there's no safety, even in your bed. Bullets, barbwire, searchlights, and sharp teeth keep you in a place you don't want to be. The food is awful and sometimes it moves, and you have no choice of what you hear or see. The lucky ones are released and return home, though their fate remains uncertain in their dreams. War may be hell, but captivity is worse, because you're never the same afterward.\n\nGeneral quarters, general quarters, everyone to their battle stations! Sunday morning, December 7th, as war confronted our nation. We quickly realized it wasn't a drill, but real war. As you see the death of friends and shipmates, you feel more anger than fear. Japanese warplanes flew in low, as I aimed with my gun sight. From the deck of a ship anchored at Pearl, damaged, though the crew still wanted to fight. I saw the face of a pilot who crashed, surrounded by black smoke and fire. Some of my bullets must have hit their mark, as his death was my desire! Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-three were killed in a battle lasting less than two hours. With the heart of our Pacific fleet gone, Japan had demonstrated their naval power. The bombing and strafing of ships and troops led our Congress to declare full war, where many men died for their flag, country, and more.\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, he applied for sea duty in the war, where Lieutenant John F. Kennedy became known for his bravery and more. In the dark hours before dawn on August 2, of 43, Kennedy commanded a torpedo boat through the blackness of the night at sea. PT 109 was on Solomon's patrol with a 12-man crew in a plywood craft. A Japanese destroyer plowed through the night, ramming and cutting Kennedy's boat in half. Two of the crew disappeared, and a third was badly burned. Kennedy was thrown to the deck, where in pain he earned his leadership. Some of his men had never learned to swim as he gathered them on the bobbing bow. As the hours passed and it seemed it would sink, they made for an island, and here's how.

{"id": 7260, "text": "The story follows a woman without a name as she looks for her mother, and also Teresa de la Landre, who says she is her mother. The book has three sections: the first focuses on the main character, the second is Teresa de la Landre's point of view, and the third goes back to the main character. After the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro in 1959, the main character's grandfather takes his baby granddaughter to America, because his daughter (the main character\u2019s mother) asked him to. Growing up in Miami, the main character doesn't know much about her family or Cuba. After years of unanswered questions, the main character asks her grandfather about her history, especially about her mother. He says that his daughter wanted her to leave Cuba and promised to meet them again in six months. Even though the grandfather didn't want to separate his daughter from her child, he did what she asked. The grandfather remembers finding his daughter's goodbye note on his granddaughter's sweater after they arrived safely in Miami. He couldn't return to Cuba because of the political problems between America and Cuba, and he couldn't get in touch with his daughter. Even though the main character now knows more about her background, she still feels lost, drops out of college, and travels the world. While traveling, the main character learns that her grandfather has died and goes back to America. She realizes that she has less of a chance of finding her mother, so she goes to Cuba with her mother's goodbye note. She can't find her mother, so she goes back to Miami, starts working as a travel writer, and tries to forget about her past. When a mysterious package arrives from Spain, the main character becomes interested in her family history again. The package contains photos and letters from Teresa de la Landre, who claims to be her mother. The second part of the book involves the main character going through the contents of the package to find out more about her family. At first, she doesn't believe the letters, but she reads about Teresa's life, her job as a painter, and her marriage to Calixto de la Landre. In her letters, Teresa also says that she had an affair with Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and that the main character is their child. The possible connection between the main character and Guevara is important because he is famous throughout the world, especially in Cuban culture. Guevara helped Castro take control of Cuba, and his desire to help the poor and oppressed work together to overthrow imperialist governments made him even more of a legend. Realizing that being the illegitimate daughter of such a famous person could have a big impact, the main character wants to learn more about her past. In the third part of the book, the main character tries to confirm Teresa's story, especially her claim that she had an affair with Guevara and that she is their child. The main character contacts Dr. Caraballo, a history professor, and Jacinto Alcazar, a photographer who briefly knew Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Since neither of them believe that Guevara and Teresa had an affair, the main character goes to Cuba again. This time, she wants to confirm Teresa's story and find her mother. During this trip to Cuba, the main character understands herself better by connecting with her country of birth. Even though she doesn't find her mother \u2013 a Cuban local says that her mother is dead \u2013 or find out if Teresa and Guevara were her parents, the main character no longer feels disconnected from her heritage. Before, when she visited Cuba, she felt detached, like a tourist. But on this trip, she sees the city in a new, more positive way and calls herself Cuban. Because of this connection to Cuba, the main character also sees Guevara in a new way. She didn't know much about Guevara before receiving Teresa's letters, but now she has read many books about him and feels like he is less foreign to her. Seeing a picture of Guevara in a Manhattan store, the main character thinks about what could have been: \u201ca beautiful stranger, who in a different dream, might have been the father of my heart\u201d (226).", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

He expressed his enthusiasm about leading the great but struggling club. He acknowledged the work required to return the club to the Premiership and pledged to do everything possible with the fans' help. Bates' stake was purchased through The Forward Sports Fund, a Geneva-based company. He intends to repurchase Leeds' Elland Road stadium and Thorp Arch training ground. Bates stated that stabilizing cash flow and resolving creditor issues would be difficult but achievable. He said the focus could shift from crisis management to club management. Gerald Krasner, the outgoing chairman, stated that the deal secures the club's long-term future and benefits the club. He believes Leeds United will consolidate and progress under Bates. Krasner stated that his board reduced the club's debt from \u00a3103m to under \u00a325m since taking over in March 2004. He asserted that his team had resolved most of Leeds United's issues and reached an agreement with Bates to ensure future success. Krasner mentioned that his consortium would remain in the background to assist with the transition. He will remain unpaid, while Peter Lorimer will stay on as director and fan liaison, and Peter McCormick will act as a consultant to the new board. The outgoing directors agreed to leave their \u00a34.5m loans in the company for four years. Lorimer, Yvonne Todd, and Mark Taylor are expected to join the new-look board. Krasner declined to disclose the takeover's financial details, stating that Bates could reveal them if he wanted. He stated that the deal was not about money for the current board, and that he had not seen any checks until recently. He added that internal arrangements are not discussed. Bates left his role as Chelsea chairman in March of the previous year, following Roman Abramovich's \u00a3140m takeover at Stamford Bridge. His \u00a310m investment proposal for Sheffield Wednesday in May was rejected. Sebastien Sainsbury's takeover of Leeds was close but he withdrew his \u00a325m offer the previous week. His efforts failed after estimating a \u00a340m takeover cost and a \u00a310m loss for the club over the next six months.

Current advanced algorithms use digital signal processing, which demands significant rule adjustments for new patterns. Conversely, deep learning algorithms, especially for categorization, are becoming more popular in research and industry. Still, their application is limited by a lack of model clarity and limited datasets. We show that deep learning can be effectively used for tasks requiring less interpretation by incorporating ECG identification and outlining into a segmentation structure. To do this, we modified and tested the U-Net, the most popular neural network design for image segmentation, for use with one-dimensional data. The model was trained with PhysioNet's QT database, which includes 105 ambulatory ECG recordings, for both single- and multi-lead situations. To compensate for the limited data, data regularization methods such as pre-training with poor-quality data labels, using ECG-based data augmentation, and applying strong model regularizers to the architecture were tried. Changes in the model's capabilities, like the U-Net's depth and width, along with the use of cutting-edge additions, were assessed. These changes were thoroughly tested using 5-fold cross-validation. The top-performing setup achieved precisions of 90.12%, 99.14%, and 98.25% and recalls of 98.73%, 99.94%, and 99.88% for the P, QRS, and T waves, respectively, comparable to DSP-based methods.

Concerns exist that the plan may be abandoned if GCSEs and A-levels are maintained, as suggested by Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly. Sir Mike Tomlinson received a briefing this week and reportedly feels more positive compared to his feelings based on earlier news reports. The government was still editing its response as of Friday. The chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman, expressed concern over a potentially weak government response.\n\nSheerman highlighted reports suggesting a diploma would only replace vocational qualifications, stating a need to address broader issues within secondary education and disputing the notion that academic education is strong while vocational education is weak. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also advised the government against making compromises, emphasizing the importance of the diploma's complete integrity for achieving significant improvements in participation and attainment. The QCA's concern is reflected in the recent release of advice given to ministers last December. It is understood that a White Paper requires broader ministerial support than solely from the Department for Education and Skills. Contentment may arise if the paper avoids limiting future options, regardless of how it is presented.\n\nChief Inspector of Schools David Bell also advocated for phasing out GCSEs and A-levels to symbolize comprehensive change. He stated that failing to recognize this as a fundamental shift would be a missed opportunity. Universities and head teachers across both independent and state schools support the Tomlinson proposals, including higher grades at advanced level to distinguish top students. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has consistently voiced concerns about skill shortages, which the Tomlinson plan aims to address with \"functional\" maths and literacy tests, not GCSEs.

Edges are created by separating the image into catchment basins using a membership function. A closed contour algorithm then identifies closed regions, and objects within them are segmented based on intensity. The algorithm's effectiveness is assessed through objective and subjective measures. Results indicate it outperforms traditional Sobel edge detection and watershed segmentation.

The actual story begins with the goddess Diana, also known as Cynthia, who has commanded a \"ceremonial festivity\" in the valley of Gargaphie in Greece. The gods Cupid and Mercury arrive, and they also begin to disagree. Mercury has woken Echo, who mourns Narcissus, and declares that consuming water from Narcissus's fountain causes people to \"Become foolishly infatuated with themselves.\" The nobles and women gathered for Cynthia's festivities all drink from the fountain. Asotus, a silly waster who desires to be a nobleman and a master of style and behavior, also drinks from the fountain; made brave by pride and egotism, he dares everyone to a contest of \"courtly flattery.\" The contest takes place, in four parts, and the noblemen are defeated. Two representative masked performances are acted within the drama for the assembled partygoers.

While showing promise, PFE's original formulation is computationally expensive for large images. This work suggests two algorithm improvements for PFE computation: adapting parts for parallel linear algebra operations, and using an iterative linear solver (preconditioned conjugate gradient) to efficiently solve a linear least-squares problem within a nested iteration. Applying these improvements to a public image database, PFE is sped up significantly without decreasing segmentation performance.

On January 1, 1985, Ernie Wise, a comedian, placed the inaugural call on the Vodafone network. Mobile phones have since become essential to daily living, with approximately 90% of Britons possessing one. Many individuals rely solely on their mobile phones, rarely using traditional landlines.\n\nAlthough the initial mobile phone call occurred in New York in 1973, the first commercial mobile service debuted ten years later. In 1985, the UK quickly followed, establishing networks for making calls on the move. The initial call originated from St Katherine's dock and was directed to Vodafone's Newbury headquarters, located above a curry restaurant at the time. For the first nine days, Vodafone was the sole mobile network in the UK. Cellnet (now O2) launched its service on January 10th. A Vodafone spokesperson, Mike Caudwell, noted that the original phones were briefcase-sized, cost around \u00a32,000, and had a battery life of about 20 minutes.\n\nDespite these limitations, they were very popular in the mid-1980s and became a status symbol for young, wealthy business people. These phones utilized analog radio signals, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping. It took Vodafone nearly nine years to acquire its first million customers, but only 18 months to gain the second million. In 1983, their market projection was two million users in total; Cellnet predicted half that number. Vodafone now has 14 million UK customers. Cellnet and Vodafone remained the only UK mobile operators until the 1993 launch of One2One (now T-Mobile), followed by Orange in 1994. The new companies used digital mobile networks and today all operators use this technology. The older analog spectrum has been discontinued. The Global System for Mobiles (GSM) is now the dominant phone technology worldwide, supporting over 1.2 billion users. Mr. Caudwell added that digital technology enabled features like text messaging and roaming, contributing to the mobile's popularity.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 7308, "text": "Standard Chartered, a bank with headquarters in the United Kingdom, announced plans to invest $3.3 billion, or \u00a31.8 billion, to purchase a major retail bank located in South Korea.\n\nStandard Chartered stated that the acquisition of Korea First Bank, known as KFB, would achieve a key strategy to expand its presence within the third largest economy of Asia. The price of Standard Chartered shares in London decreased by almost 3% because the bank secured funding for the acquisition through the sale of \u00a31 billion (equivalent to $1.8 billion) in new stock shares, which represents 10% of its capital stock. Standard Chartered estimates about 16% of future revenue for the larger company will be generated by KFB.\n\nThe assets of the South Korean bank will account for 22% of total assets of the larger company. The deal, coming a year after Citigroup edged out Standard Chartered to take over Koram bank, would represent the largest purchase of a South Korean financial institution by a foreign entity. Standard Chartered is reported to have outbid HSBC in this particular transaction. KFB, ranked as the seventh largest bank in South Korea, possesses a widespread network of branches and serves 3 million individual banking customers, representing 6% of the banking market in the country.\n\nThe value of the South Korean banking sector is three times that of Hong Kong, generating $44 billion in revenue on an annual basis. Standard Chartered, while headquartered in London, generates two-thirds of its revenue from Asia, and a substantial amount of the remaining revenue from Africa. Mervyn Davies, chief executive of Standard Chartered, remarked at a press conference in London, \"We're comfortable with the price paid...the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won\". According to Standard Chartered, KFB is a \"well-managed, conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce\" that represents a \"significant acquisition in a growth market\". In London, the sale of 118 million shares by Standard Chartered to institutional investors had a negative impact on its share price, contributing to the FTSE 100's 0.3% decrease. By midday, Standard Chartered's shares were trading at 925p, down 28 pence. Some analysts also questioned if Standard Chartered might have paid too much for KFB. Standard Chartered anticipates that the deal, which is contingent on regulatory clearances, will be finalized by April 2005 and will increase profits in 2006.\n\nHSBC, a rival banking firm with headquarters in London and Hong Kong, was also bidding for the acquisition. It is believed that Standard Chartered gained an advantage by assembling a proposal during the Christmas break. According to an insider quoted by the Financial Times, \"They were able to move so quickly it caught HSBC by surprise.\" HSBC will now be required to wait for the sale of the next South Korean bank, which is likely to be Korea Exchange Bank, which is now held by a US group. Standard Chartered announced it was purchasing 100% of KFB, a deal that will put an end to the bank's convoluted dual ownership arrangement. The South Korean government owns 51.4% of KFB, while Newbridge Capital, a US private equity firm, holds the remaining ownership and operational control. Newbridge acquired its ownership stake as part of the government's nationalization of multiple banks following the 1997 Asian currency crisis, which had a crippling effect on South Korea's financial system.\n\nThe South Korean economy is predicted to grow by 4.5% this year. Despite the common perception of South Korea as an export-oriented economy, the service sector has outstripped manufacturing in the last ten to twenty years. Services currently account for approximately 40% of the economy, while consumer spending and retail banking have become progressively significant. The government encouraged the expansion of consumer credit in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. This was followed by problems with bad loans; for example, LG Card, the nation's leading credit card provider, has been fighting to prevent bankruptcy for a number of months. However, experts think that South Korea's financial services industry is still young and provides a lot of chances for the development of new products. Standard Chartered believes that \"the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products\" exists. KFB has transitioned from a wholesale bank to a retail bank with an emphasis on mortgage lending since 1999, with mortgages accounting for 45% of its loan portfolio.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Worldwide sales should reach 159 million, growing by 104%. By 2008, the report forecasts that around 70% of cell phones sold will feature a camera. Improved camera technology is making them increasingly appealing. European camera phones can capture 1.3-megapixel photos. However, in Japan and the Asia Pacific region, cell phone technology is more advanced, and phones capable of taking 3.2-megapixel images are already available. Japan is a leader in cell phone technology, with very high adoption rates. Gartner predicts that 95% of cell phones sold in Japan by 2008 will include cameras.\n\nEarly camera phones had issues like low-quality images, unclear uses, and the difficulties and costs of sending pictures via MMS. These issues have lessened in the last year and a half. Cell phone manufacturers have been trying to simplify phone operation. They've added design features like rotating screens, viewfinders, removable memory cards, and easier controls for sending photos.\n\nMobile providers have introduced ways for users to share photos, like publishing them on websites or mobile blogs. The report argues that until image quality is improved, people won't be interested in printing photos at kiosks. Image sensor technology in camera phones is getting better. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, most camera phones will likely have image resolutions of over two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras typically range from two to four megapixels, with high-end cameras reaching six megapixels. Efforts are underway to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some phones already have zoom, and manufacturers are researching ways to take photos in low light. Other advancements include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording video.\n\nCamera phone images have been used in art. An upcoming exhibition will feature photos taken with camera phones by well-known artists to benefit the Mencap charity.\n\nThe \"Fonetography\" exhibition will showcase images from photographers such as David Bailey, Rankin, and Nan Goldin, as well as artists like Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin, and Jack Vettriano. However, some uses of camera phones have caused concern for some organizations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US have banned camera phones from their buildings to protect sensitive information. Many schools, gyms, and local governments have also banned them due to privacy concerns. Italy's information commissioner has expressed concerns and issued guidelines on their use. Despite these concerns, camera phone sales haven't hurt manufacturers' profits. Sony Ericsson's profits reportedly tripled in the third quarter because of new camera phones, with over 60% of phones sold featuring cameras.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Lung cancer staging significantly affects prognosis, and measuring the size of the invasive area in pathology images is crucial. Image segmentation can help visualize invasive and non-invasive areas, aiding pathological analysis. Existing supervised learning segmentation methods struggle with unlabeled pathology images. This paper puts forward a combined method for unsupervised representation learning and clustering for segmenting these images. The method involves two stages: learning feature representations of training patches using spherical k-means to get cluster centroids for feature extraction, and then applying k-means to representations extracted by those centroids, projecting cluster labels onto the images. The method was tested on lung cancer pathology images, and it performed better than traditional k-means and the multithreshold Otsu method, both in measurable data and visual assessment, achieving a higher normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 0.626 compared to 0.168 and 0.167.

John Toshack, who is coaching his inaugural game after taking over from Mark Hughes, expressed his surprise that Giggs had only now reached this milestone, considering the amount of games Giggs has played for Manchester United. Toshack believes Giggs is one of the best Welsh players ever and that being captain is appropriate for his 50th game. Giggs considered retiring from international football at one point, but now wants to participate in the 2008 European Championships with Wales. Sir Alex Ferguson, Giggs' manager at Manchester United, convinced him to prolong his international career. Ferguson felt Giggs was fit and able to play in the European finals in a few years if Wales qualified. Ferguson has always supported Giggs playing for both club and country and encouraged him to continue because of his fitness. Giggs thought about following Gary Speed and Paul Scholes by focusing solely on club football but is now intent on making Toshack's tenure more successful than Hughes'. Giggs first played for Wales as a 17-year-old in 1991, in a loss against Germany, and is now making his 50th appearance at the age of 31. Giggs leading Wales against Hungary suggests he could become Speed's permanent replacement as captain, but Toshack wouldn't say if he saw Giggs as a long-term option. Toshack said it was fitting for Giggs to be captain for this particular match, given it is his 50th cap. Giggs said he was looking forward to the game and hoped to play many more times for Wales. He believes it is important to be present, and all the players agree that it's a new beginning. Giggs sees himself leading by example, which he has done for Wales and Manchester United in recent seasons. Toshack plans to build his team around experienced players leading up to the Euro 2006 tournament. Giggs told Toshack he plans to be available for the next European tournament when he will be 35. Giggs' future at Manchester United is uncertain because he hasn't agreed to a new contract; Manchester United offered a one-year extension, while Giggs wants two. Giggs has put contract talks aside to concentrate on an important period for the club. He has heard talk about a two-year deal and is hoping to get it sorted out because that is what he is looking for. He is enjoying his football and Manchester United's form.

Earth struggles to recover from two centuries of conflict that began with the Soviet takeover of North America during World War III and ended with the Solar System's unification after a war between Mars and Venus. Twenty-two years after faster-than-light travel was discovered, Troas remains the only Earthlike planet, but interest in interstellar travel dwindles. If Troas cannot be colonized, humanity might abandon interstellar travel altogether. The second Troas expedition faces numerous obstacles. The Lagrange Institute must construct its own starship, the Henry Hudson, due to the inability to charter one. The Hudson's construction suffers from delays, increased costs, and sabotage. During the voyage to Troas, tensions rise among the expedition members. The ship's psychomed, Edward Avery, fails to maintain harmony, leading to at least one physical altercation. Arriving at Troas, the Hudson's crew discovers no sign of the first expedition. Following confirmation that Troas is free of harmful microorganisms, a base camp is set up. Eighteen days later, aliens appear. Avery is tasked with deciphering their language but claims it's exceptionally challenging. He eventually identifies the aliens as the Rorvan, native to Troas. This jeopardizes the expedition, as planets with indigenous intelligent life are protected from colonization.

{"id": 7324, "text": "In the spring of 1142, the Benedictine monks of Shrewsbury Abbey anticipate the June 22 feast celebrating Saint Winifred's transfer from Wales to their altar. Shrewsbury remains unaffected by the Anarchy's political instability. Earlier that year, during the King's illness, Empress Maud resided in Oxford, while Robert of Gloucester, her steadfast ally, consulted with her family in Normandy. King Stephen's renewed activity, including the capture of Wareham, bolstered his supporters. Sheriff Hugh Beringar visits his northern manor to oversee his sheep. The Abbey has an additional obligation on that day for the past three years: completing their agreement with the widow Judith Perle. Her husband's death and her subsequent miscarriage occurred twenty days later, over three years prior. She donated her home and lands in the Foregate to the Abbey, constituting half of her inheritance, through a charter, in exchange for a single white rose from the garden, delivered personally. Brother Eluric, responsible for the altar funded by the house's rent, has fulfilled this rose delivery each year. Eight days before the fourth delivery, he asks Abbot Radulfus to relieve him of this duty, due to his overwhelming desire for Judith Perle. Abbot Radulfus grants his request. After conferring with Cadfael and Anselm, the Abbot chooses Niall, the bronzesmith renting the property from the abbey, to deliver the rose rent. Judith visits the bronzesmith, seeking a new buckle for a girdle; he is captivated by her beauty and loneliness. Judith Perle, despite having several suitors, is uninterested in remarriage, still mourning her happy marriage. She discusses the possibility of taking the veil with Sister Magdalen, considering life with the sisters at Godric's Ford. Sister Magdalen advises her to wait but assures her that a place to rest and contemplate is always available. Niall, a widower, keeps his young daughter with his sister in Pulley, just three miles away. Returning from an overnight visit, he discovers that the white rose bush has been hacked at the trunk. Brother Eluric lies dead at its base, a knife beside him. While investigating the murder scene with the Abbot and Brother Anselm, Brother Cadfael finds a distinct footprint and makes a wax impression. Cadfael informs Judith about Brother Eluric's feelings for her. That night, before retiring, Judith tells her servant Branwen that she will go to the abbey in the morning to draft a new charter, making the property gift unconditional. The following day, Judith does not arrive at the abbey. Sheriff Hugh Beringar, recalled to town, Cadfael, and Abbot Radulfus suspect Judith has been kidnapped, either for forced marriage or to invalidate the charter by her absence on rent day. The search commences. Cadfael discovers the bronze tag from Judith's girdle, suggesting a struggle, under the bridge where a boat had been hauled up for convenient use, possibly stolen by the kidnapper. Cadfael's river search with Madog uncovers a stolen boat discarded downstream on the River Severn. Bertred, one of Judith's foremen, recalls that on the night Judith announced her intent to remake the charter, one of Vivian Hynde's men left abruptly after Branwen shared that information. Bertred believes he knows her location, having followed Hynde or his man out of town after the day's search concluded. In the middle of the night, he approaches Hynde's disused counting-house, now a wool storage outbuilding. It had been searched that day, but the unused room was unknown to the Deputy Sheriff, nor mentioned by the owner. Bertred overhears Judith Perle inside with her gaoler, Vivian Hynde. Unexpectedly, Judith is in control of the situation. Vivian pleads with Judith to marry him, but she rejects him with scorn. Bertred, holding onto the window sill, causes it to give way, alerting those within and the watchdog. Bertred flees toward the river. The watchman and his dog pursue. The watchman strikes him a glancing blow to the head, but Bertred dives into the water, striking rocks and losing consciousness. The watchman does not follow, believing the intruder is swimming across the river. Back in the counting-house, Judith convinces Vivian to take her to Sister Magdalen, where she will claim she has been in retreat for the past days. She promises to keep Vivian's secret, wanting to preserve her reputation and put the event behind her. He agrees, and they slip away to stay at his mother's house until they can depart for Godric's Ford. Someone finds Bertred in the shallows, checks for life, and then kicks him into the river's current. Cadfael, working near the river the next morning, discovers Bertred's dead body. Examining Bertred's body, Cadfael notices his boots match the wax impression found near the rose bush when Brother Eluric was murdered. They appear to have found Brother Eluric's killer. Hugh and Cadfael speak with the watchman and discover that Bertred had been at Vivian Hynde's storehouse the previous night, where they find the broken window sill. They request to search the premises but find no sign of the pair's presence. Niall visits his daughter in Pulley again, wanting to bring her home but deciding to wait until Shrewsbury is calmer. Returning on a moonless night, he hears noises and takes cover, suspecting bandits. He sees a man on horseback with a woman riding behind him, whom he recognizes as Judith Perle. He follows them for an hour until he overhears Judith instructing the man to let her walk the rest of the way alone. After the man leaves, Niall approaches and hears her scream as someone attacks her with a knife. He fights off her attacker, knocking the knife away but sustaining a gash on his left arm. The attacker flees. Niall and Judith continue to the Benedictine nuns at Godric's Ford. Judith recounts their story to Sister Magdalen, who agrees to support Judith's deception about being with the Sisters for three days, understanding the importance of her reputation. Sister Magdalen accompanies them back to the Abbey, then to town, staying close to Judith until all is well. After returning home, Judith tells Hugh the tale of her attack, explaining that after Vivian released her, she wants the matter closed and will not testify against him. Vivian was with her when they heard Bertred fall and be chased by the night watchman, so he could not have killed Bertred. Hugh relents, informing her that Vivian Hynde is already taken; Hugh will release him eventually. Cadfael asks Sister Magdalen to obtain two well-worn left shoes from Judith's household. She sends them via Edwy Bellecote the carpenter's son, a trusted messenger. He delivers them to Cadfael, who examines Bertred's shoe. It does not match the mold of the print from Brother Eluric's murder. The other shoe does match. Suspecting more trouble with the rose bush, Cadfael finds it engulfed in flames; the fire draws many locals to ensure it doesn't spread. The bush was doused in oil and ignited with a torch from over the wall, and it is destroyed. Early the next morning, the day of St Winifred's translation, Hugh visits Judith Perle's home to ask her cousin Miles when he gave his boots to Bertred. Miles' mother reveals that he did it on the day Brother Eluric was found dead. Miles had killed Brother Eluric and then given his boots to Bertred. Miles confesses all, trying to excuse his guilt, and Hugh's men take him away to await trial. Judith is hurt by this betrayal. Cadfael and Hugh explain their understanding of the events. Miles, hoping that Judith would enter the convent and leave her shop and property to him, had the idea to destroy the rose bush, causing the house to revert to her estate. But Eluric discovered and stopped him in the first attack on the rose tree, so Miles stabbed him, leaving that boot print. Later, he followed Bertred to the Hynde property and killed him. The next night he followed Judith en route to Godric's Ford, where he tried to kill her, stopped by the unexpected Niall. Miles is the only person with a motive to kill Judith, as he would inherit her business and property. Cadfael and Judith reflect sadly that Miles never intended to do so much evil, but his first step, motivated by ambition and greed, led him down a path he did not escape. Her house emptied, first by Hugh, Cadfael and Sister Magdalen leaving, then the funeral for Bertred. She has two childless widows to support now. She told her aunt what she must know about her lost son. Judith is left with the full responsibility of the clothier business, and will remake the charter with the Abbey, making a full gift of that house. In mid afternoon of Saint Winifred's day, Niall and his young daughter Rosalba arrive at Judith's house with a white rose. He had picked the bloom yesterday, before the fire. He delivers the rose rent to her, thus securing the charter. He begins to leave, but Judith asks him to stay, rediscovering her reasons to live.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Afsan is one of numerous apprentice astrologers who have studied under Saleed, each dismissed for reasons that remain unclear. Later, Afsan inadvertently intrudes upon a disagreement between Saleed and Var-Keenir, his former creche-mate and a master mariner. Keenir presents Saleed with a new invention called a \"Far-Seer\", hoping it will be useful for his work, but the traditionalist astrologer dismisses the offer. However, Afsan is eager to use the Far-Seer to observe The Face of God, a mysterious object in the sky revered by the Quintaglios. Offended by the suggestion, Saleed reprimands Afsan and orders him to the palace Hall of Worship to atone for his blasphemy. After arriving at the hall of worship, Afsan encounters Det-Yenalb, Master of the Faith. The high priest notices Afsan's height and that he should have already undertaken his coming-of-age pilgrimage to see The Face of God. Yenalb advises Afsan to first go on a hunt, as many are lost during the Pilgrimage and he has yet to earn his hunting tattoo; any Quintaglio who hasn't yet earned one will not be allowed into heaven. Afsan follows Yenalb's advice and meets with his friend, Prince Dybo, who has also not yet completed his pilgrimage or earned a hunting tattoo. After sharing Hornface meat with Afsan and receiving encouragement from Pal-Cadool, the palace butcher, Dybo agrees to join Afsan on his pilgrimage and earn a hunting tattoo as well. Before departing with Dybo, Afsan is summoned by Dybo's mother, Empress Len-Lends. Displaying her claws, she informs him that he is responsible for Dybo's safe return, or he will be punished. Visibly shaken by the Empress's threat, Afsan leaves to go on his hunt with Dybo. Afsan and Dybo arrive at the Hunter's Shrine and join the pack of Jal-Tetex, the imperial hunt leader. During the hunt, they target a massive Thunderbeast, the biggest ever seen. The pack engages in a long and difficult battle against the massive sauropod, and Asfan kills it by climbing its neck and tearing out its throat, jumping away at the last second to avoid getting crushed. Afsan is hailed as a hero, praised for his innate skill on his first hunt. After returning from the hunt, Afsan and Dybo board the Dasheter, a sailing vessel commanded by Var-Keenir. Keenir's tail is a stump, having been torn off in an earlier encounter with a sea monster he calls Kal-Ta-Goot. Keenir allows Afsan to borrow his Far-Seer, which Afsan uses to study the heavens and The Face of God. The Dasheter sails across the ocean, and Afsan's careful observations of the stars have led him to a surprising realization - the planets, once appearing as distant points of light, resembled The Face of God, indicating it is a natural object, not a deity. Furthermore, moons orbited these planets, and Afsan theorized that the Quintaglio's world, traditionally thought of as a giant \"boat\" of land floating down a massive river, is actually a moon covered by water, orbiting The Face of God. Afsan shares his discovery with captain Var-Keenir and attempts to persuade him to sail east to test his hypothesis. Keenir refuses, citing the risk of sailing into uncharted waters. However, Kal-Ta-Goot is spotted heading east, and Keenir, seeking vengeance, orders its pursuit. After weeks of following Kal-Ta-Goot, the creature attacks the Dasheter. Several sailors are consumed in the ensuing battle, but Afsan again demonstrates his hunting skills, killing the serpent by strangling it with the ship's anchor. Grateful to Afsan for saving his life, Keenir grants Afsan a request. Afsan requests that the Dasheter stay on course, and Keenir agrees, much to the dismay of priest Det-Bleen and sailor Nor-Gampar. When Det-Bleen confronts Keenir, it is revealed that Keenir is a Lubalite, a member of a cult that was once the dominant religion before the prophet Larsk sailed across the ocean and discovered The Face of God. Shortly after, while Afsan is explaining to Dybo why they are continuing to sail east despite having killed Kal-Ta-Goot, they are approached by Nor-Gampar, who is in full dagamant, the animalistic rage that overtakes Quintaglios when forced into extended contact with each other. Gampar attacks Dybo, and Afsan tries to protect him, and all three are drawn into a dagamant-fueled fight to the death. Afsan kills Gampar, and almost attacks Dybo before the dagamant wears off. The Dasheter continues to sail onward, eventually landing on the western edge of Land, as Afsan predicted. While the Dasheter has stopped for maintenance, Afsan and Dybo learn that Len-Lends, the Empress, was killed when an earthquake caused the palace ceiling to collapse on her. By inheritance, Prince Dybo is now Emperor Dy-Dybo, ruler of all the land. In view of this, Dybo must return to capital city immediately. Afsan bids him adieu, deciding to take a more leisurely route back to the capital. During his travels, Afsan decides to meet with Wab-Novato, the inventor of the Far-Seer. Afsan learns that she has also been observing the planets and the moons, and they exchange knowledge. Together, they conclude that the rings surrounding certain planets are made up of moons that orbit too close to large planets and break apart. This leads to an even more shocking conclusion: their world, which is a moon, is orbiting dangerously close to The Face of God and will one day crumble into a ring as well. The mental stimulation of sharing their knowledge ignites their passion and culminates with an impulsive act of sexual intercourse between the two. The following morning, Novato gives Afsan one of her Far-Seers, and he leaves to continue his journey back to Capital City to share this knowledge with Emperor Dybo. Later, Afsan stops at his home-town of Pack Carno. Whilst there, he peeks in the Pack's nursery, and witnesses a shocking event: a male Quintaglio, garbed in a purple robe, chasing and devouring all but one of the hatchlings from an entire clutch of eggs. Afsan learns that this Quintaglio is what is known as a Hal-Pataars; a Bloodpriest. It has been their job since ancient times to control the Quintaglio population by culling all but the single strongest hatchlings from each clutch of eggs. Shaken by the event, he later wonders if the governors of the province- who all bear a resemblance to Len-Lends, the former Empress- were exempted from the culling of the Bloodpriests. Afsan continues his journey back to Capital city, accompanying a convoy from Pack Carno, and with them, kills a Fangjaw, (a large, quadrupedal, saber-toothed theropod) from Runningbeast-back along the way. Eventually, he arrives back in Capital city, only to learn that Tak-Saleed had fallen ill while he was away. Afsan goes to visit his mentor at his sickbed, and tells him what he learned. Saleed confesses that he has known what Afsan knew all along, but kept it secret- he didn't want to risk losing his position, and was just too old to carry on the fight that would inevitably rise from this challenge to the Quintaglio's religion. Saleed knew that it would require an intelligent, youthful Quintaglio to fight this new fight. With his final breath, Saleed tells Afsan that the Quintaglios need to get off their world, and dies. Meanwhile, word has spread of Afsan's pilgrimage. Afsan is confronted by Gerth-Palsab, a belligerent, illiterate blacksmith, who accuses him of sacrilege. Afsan and Palsab engage in a debate, which draws a large crowd, many of whom are offended by Afsan's assertions, and others who are curious about them. Present in the crowd is a Junior Priest, who tells Det-Yenalb about Afsan's theory. Det-Yenalb, having heard rumours about Keenir, believes that the mariner has poisoned Afsan's mind with Lubalite blasphemy. When Afsan finally reunites with Dybo, he finds himself surrounded by Yenalb and the palace council. Yenalb tries to convince Afsan that he is mistaken. When he asserts that he isn't, Yenalb whips the council into a frenzy and persuades them into believing that Afsan is a Demon. Dybo, who has remained tactfully silent, saves Afsan from being killed on the spot by the council and orders him to be locked away in the palace basement. While Afsan is incarcerated, Pal-Cadool arrives to bring him meat. Cadool tells Afsan that Dybo is Emperor by divine right, being the descendant of the prophet Larsk- his theory cannot be made common knowledge or Dybo will have no right to rule. Afsan tells Cadool that the world is doomed, and he pledges himself to his cause. Cadool tells Afsan to trust nobody except those who can make a certain hand gesture; one Afsan has seen performed before by Keenir. Pal-Cadool meets with Jal-Tetex in secret at the hunter's shrine, where it is revealed that both are Lubalites, like Keenir. Cadool and Tetex both agree that Afsan is The One, a messiah foretold by the prophecy of Lubal. They believe Yenalb will have Afsan executed, and Tetex informs Cadool that Keenir has gone to recruit fellow Lubalites to rescue him. Meanwhile, Afsan is approached by Yenalb, who tries to coerce Afsan into recanting his claims. As an alternative to execution, he offers Afsan a contract, in which he declares to disavow his theories and acknowledge Larsk as a true prophet, and that he would live safely; in exile, cut off from the rest of the Quintaglios. Afsan is tempted by Yenalb's offer but ultimately refuses. He unsheathes his claws and tears up the document, and Yenalb storms off in a rage. As punishment for his heresy, Afsan has been brought to a podium in central square for a public discipline. At the request of Dybo, Afsan is not killed. Instead, Yenalb gouges out Afsan's eyes with a ceremonial obsidian dagger, so that he can no longer claim to see the things which blaspheme God. After this, Afsan is released, allowed to live out the rest of his life, but in shame and blindness. After his blinding, Afsan becomes good friends with Jal-Tetex and Pal-Cadool, who remain by his side and aide him in his blindness. Eventually, the Lubalites arrive, who march into the central square. Afsan, from atop the back of a Shovelmouth, speaks to the Lubalites, telling them of his theories and that the world is doomed. He pleads with them to cast aside their superstition and give themselves over to knowledge, to science and reason. It is only action- not prayer -which will get them off their world and save the Quintaglios. Afsan's plea is interrupted by Yenalb, atop the back of a Spikefrill and accompanied by the palace guard, who commands the Lubalites to clear out of the square. They refuse, and a fierce battle between the two factions ensues. Afsan is kept safe by the Lubalites during the conflict, and Cadool confronts Yenalb in combat atop the Spikefrill. Yenalb is no match for the butcher and Cadool emerges triumphant by biting off his head, killing him in Afsan's honor. The battle between the Lubalites and the palace guard is interrupted when an earthquake, triggered by the eruption of the nearby Ch'Mar volcanoes, destroys Capital City. Though many are killed in the eruption, many more manage to escape by boarding the Dasheter: among them, Afsan, Cadool, Tetex, Keenir, and Emperor Dybo. Afsan learns that Novato is on the Dasheter as well- with their eight children, who were spared the culling of the Bloodpriests, since no Bloodpriest would dare kill the offspring of The One. While he is resting on the Dasheter, Dybo confronts Afsan, and apologises for all the terrible things he went through, and for blinding him. Dybo acknowledges the truth of Afsan's theory, tells him that all charges will be lifted and that he will be appointed the Court Astrologer and live in peace in capital city. Afsan asks Dybo to pledge himself to what would come to be known as the Quintaglio Exodus. The story ends with Dybo announcing that the Quintaglios will be going to the stars.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This paper introduces an embedding-based method that clusters pixel embeddings differentiably using a stochastic, non-parametric stick-breaking process. Like iterative refinement, the clustering orders object representations randomly, but it doesn't require pre-defined cluster counts. This enables the creation of GENESIS-V2, a new model that infers a varying quantity of object representations without RNNs or iterative refinement.

The military's financial resources will also increase by 7.8%, totaling 830 billion rupees, or $19 billion. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is prioritizing the reduction of poverty and maintaining the support of the government's Communist allies. However, a new law restricts his choices, requiring him to reduce the budget deficit, which he predicts will be 4.5% of GDP by March 2005. The overall deficit for the nation is thought to exceed 10% if the expenses of India's 35 states and territories are taken into consideration. The fiscal responsibility law mandates that Mr. Chidambaram decrease the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year, a goal he claims to have achieved for the current year.\n\nBecause of the significant expenditure on poverty reduction, the 2005-6 deficit target will be 4.3%, according to Mr. Chidambaram, which is less than what is required by the new law. He stated that he had no choice but to halt the act's progression. He did caution, though, that the following year would have to be back on course.\n\nHe stated that they are precariously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and that there is no more room for spending beyond their means. The upcoming year's reduction has involved incorporating more of India's expanding services sector businesses into the tax system and reorganizing the personal tax system, despite the fact that the budget contains numerous corporate tax and duty reductions.\n\nMr. Chidambaram stated while presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament that the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation had been brought under control. He mentioned that India's economy expanded by 6.9% in 2004. Mr. Chidambaram's budget includes:\n\nIncreased funding for elementary education to 71.56 billion rupees ($1.6 billion).\nIncreased funding for healthcare to 102.8 billion rupees ($2.35 billion).\nAn allocation of 80 billion rupees ($1.8 billion) for rural infrastructure construction.\nA pledge of 102.16 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) for tsunami victims.\nA 30% increase in the flow of funds to agriculture.\nA package for the sugar industry.\n\nIn addition, up to 100 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) for infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country's foreign exchange reserves, which will keep budgeted spending under control. Mr. Chidambaram stated that given the resilience of the Indian economy, it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty and that the whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty. The Congress Party-led new Indian government was elected last May after promising to implement economic reforms with a \"human face.\"\n\nThe finance minister says he is dedicated to reforming India's tax system and extending the tax base. He has announced the following as part of his reforms:\n\nDuty cuts on capital goods and raw materials.\nExpanded service tax net.\nRaised the income-tax threshold to 100,000 rupees ($2,300).\nReduced income tax for those earning less than 250,000 rupees ($5,700) to 20%.\nReduced corporate tax rates to 30%.\n\nAn annual economic survey released on Friday stated that India needed to relax restrictions on foreign investment, reform labor regulations, and cut duties, in addition to broadening the tax base for long-term economic growth. However, Mr. Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to prioritize increasing social spending. The Communists are likewise opposed to initiatives to boost foreign investment and permit businesses to hire and fire workers at will. They have lately expressed their displeasure with the government's economic reform plans, which include increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunications and aviation.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of current deep learning designs in segmenting nuclei in fluorescence images from various tissues and sample types without further processing. Architectures using pixel-to-pixel translation are compared to those detecting objects followed by localized segmentation. A new method for creating artificial images to expand the training dataset is also presented. The impact of annotation quality, image scale, and segmentation complexity on segmentation results is assessed. The findings indicate that most deep learning architectures can effectively segment fluorescent nuclear images across various tissue origins and sample preparation methods. Mask R-CNN, specifically designed for instance-aware segmentation, performs better than other designs.

I was homesick and wanted to cry, but I patiently waited for someone to buy me. Some said I was too big, others too small, and some passed by without a word. Then a little boy cried, 'Mom, buy that one,' but she shook her head, saying it was too expensive.\"\n\n\"So when the store closed for the evening, I was left on the littered floor, unwanted, despised, and unsold, finally thrown out into the cold alley.\"\n\nThen I spoke, \"Don't be sad.

Experiments on simulated and real images show the method's effectiveness: it provides precise segmentations for images with significant speckle and intensity variations and works with data from different sensors.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 7347, "text": "This book follows the Shaposhnikov family history and the Battle of Stalingrad. Its socialist realist writing style might seem unusual to some Westerners. One idea explored is that the Great Patriotic War involved two similar authoritarian countries. The common people faced a double burden: fighting the enemy and the oppression of their government. The story covers life on the Eastern Front broadly, presenting many stories happening concurrently across Russia and Eastern Europe. Although each narrative progresses sequentially, the events are not always ordered chronologically. A character might be introduced, then not mentioned for many pages, before a return to events that happened soon afterward. Summarizing the novel is challenging, but the plot contains three main elements: the Shtrum/Shapashnikov family, the battle in Stalingrad, and life in Soviet and Nazi camps. These plot elements appear in each of the book's three sections. Viktor Shtrum, a talented physicist, and his wife, Lyudmila, along with their daughter, Nadya, are living in Kazan after evacuating from Moscow. He is having issues with his work and his family. He then finds out that his mother, who is in a Jewish ghetto, will soon be killed. Lyudmila visits her son, Tolya, from her first marriage, in a hospital, but he passes away before she arrives. She becomes withdrawn and seems to expect Tolya's return. Viktor makes anti-government comments at his colleague Sokolov's house, partly to impress Sokolov\u2019s wife, Marya, who is also Lyudmila\u2019s only friend. He draws comparisons between political situations and physics, noting the similarities between fascism and Stalinism. He fears being reported for these discussions, and this uncertainty affects his later decisions. Viktor has a major breakthrough in his mathematical work and solves problems hindering his experiments. While his colleagues initially respond slowly, they eventually acknowledge the significance of his discovery. However, after moving back to Moscow, his work is criticized by authorities as anti-Leninist and his Jewish heritage is attacked. Viktor refuses to publicly recant his views and is forced to quit his job. Fearing arrest, he receives a call from Stalin himself, reversing his situation immediately, likely due to Stalin realizing the importance of nuclear research for the military. Later, he signs a letter condemning two innocent individuals, which leads to him feeling great remorse. The last thing written about Viktor regards his unconsummated affair with Marya. The Stalingrad storyline focuses on Yevghenia Shapashnikova, Lyudmila\u2019s sister, Krymov, her former husband, and Novikov, her lover. Yevghenia reconnects with Novikov and evacuates to Kuibyshev. Novikov, a Soviet tank corps commander, meets General Nyeudobnov and Political Commissar Getmanov, who are both party loyalists. Together, they begin to plan a counter-attack on Stalingrad. Novikov delays the attack because he does not want to needlessly endanger his soldiers. Getmanov then denounces Novikov, and he is summoned for trial, despite the success of the tank assault. Krymov, a political commissar, investigates House 6/I, where a small group of soldiers has been holding off the Germans, even though they are surrounded and cut off from supplies. The commanding officer, Grekov, refuses to send reports and is contemptuous of Krymov\u2019s rhetoric. He later wounds Krymov, causing him to be evacuated. Soon afterward, House 6/I is destroyed by German bombs. Krymov, a staunch communist, is then accused of being a traitor, a common occurrence for Russian soldiers trapped behind enemy lines, and is sent to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, where he is beaten and forced to confess. Yevghenia decides not to marry Novikov and travels to Moscow to visit Krymov. He receives a package from her and realizes he still loves her but might never be freed. The camp stories feature few repeating characters, except for Mostovskoy, an Old Bolshevik involved in a plot to rebel against the Germans. He is disheartened by the lack of faith in Communism. His interrogator, Liss, argues that Fascism and Communism are two sides of the same coin, which deeply upsets Mostovskoy. He is eventually killed by the Germans for his role in the uprising. One scene shows Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Liss telling old Bolshevik Mostovsky, a Nazi concentration camp inmate, that both Stalin and Hitler are the leaders of qualitatively new formation. Liss asserts that both leaders and their followers are mirror images of one another. Grossman also describes Sofya Levinton, a Jewish woman en route to a Nazi extermination camp. As Grossman transitions into the book\u2019s third part, his writing becomes more analytical, and many characters are left behind. The only plotlines that conclude are those where the protagonists die during the war. He suggests these characters are part of a larger, ongoing narrative about Russia and humanity. The final chapter reinforces this idea of universality. The author introduces a set of characters who remain anonymous: an elderly widow watching her tenants, a wounded army officer recently released from the hospital, his wife, and their young daughter. Grossman describes the type of Communist party functionaries, who blindly follow the party line and constitute the base for the oppressive regime. One such political worker (\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a), Sagaidak, maintained that entire families and villages intentionally starved themselves to death during the collectivization in the USSR.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 7360, "text": "The highest court determined that government immigration policies unfairly targeted Roma individuals seeking UK entry. This followed the Home Office's attempts to decrease asylum applications by preventing primarily Roma people from boarding UK-bound flights originating in Prague. Liberty asserted this revealed systemic racism within the government's asylum procedures. The Home Office denied discriminatory intent and committed to reviewing the decision's ramifications, while also noting the controls were no longer active due to Czech citizens' current freedom of movement within Europe. These airport screenings occurred in July 2001, amid concerns about increasing asylum seeker arrivals in Britain. Those denied \"pre-clearance\" were effectively barred from traveling to the UK due to airline refusal to transport them. Lady Hale stated many Roma faced persecution in the Czech Republic, justifying their desire to leave, but were treated with greater suspicion than non-Roma passengers by immigration officers motivated by race. She argued for equal treatment of all potential passengers, with heightened scrutiny only warranted by specific justification. Liberty pointed to statistics suggesting Roma Czechs were significantly more likely to be stopped by British immigration officials in Prague compared to non-Roma Czechs. They represented six anonymous Roma Czechs denied UK entry and the European Roma Rights Centre, which condemned the measures as unfairly targeting Roma people. They initially lost a High Court case in 2002, where the judge deemed the system no more objectionable than a visa control system and stated Britain had no obligation to prevent potential refugees from approaching its border to claim asylum. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal determined the practice almost certainly discriminated against Roma but considered it justified due to their higher likelihood of seeking asylum. Immigration law permits discrimination against citizens from specific countries but prohibits further measures. A Home Office spokesperson stated the scheme was a short-term response to high numbers of ineligible passengers from Prague. Maeve Sherlock of the Refugee Council criticized the government's denial of entry to a vulnerable group, citing documented human rights abuses against Roma in Eastern Europe. Jan Shaw of Amnesty International found it bleakly ironic that the government's asylum policy was being applied discriminatorily, as discrimination often underlies serious human rights abuses.

Schuyler supports Samuel J. Tilden in the hopes of being granted a diplomatic posting that would allow him to go back to Europe. The beginning of the book explores the Schuylers' integration into New York society and Emma's engagement to John Day Apgar, a rich but unexciting young lawyer from a prominent family. The latter part of the book follows Schuyler's time in Washington, DC, and Emma's developing friendship with the wealthy Denise Sanford and her uncouth husband, William. Emma and Denise become good friends, but after Denise's death during childbirth, Emma ends her engagement with Apgar and marries Sanford. The story unfolds against the background of the close 1876 U.S. presidential election between Tilden and Rutherford B. Hayes. Despite Tilden winning the popular vote, the election results in four states, including Florida, were disputed. Republican leaders in Florida initially announced a Tilden victory, but subsequently declared Hayes the winner. Vidal develops this historical crisis through the actions of fictional and real figures, some of whom were previously in Burr, or are related to characters from that book.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Elfyn Llwyd from Plaid Cymru has put forward the idea that security agencies might have had a part, wanting to hurt the reputation of nationalist voters. Lord Roberts of Conwy, a former Welsh Office Minister, has denied the involvement of security forces. This year, in March, North Wales Police reopened the case, announcing they would examine stored materials for possible DNA evidence.\n\nMeibion Glyndwr, meaning \"sons of Glyndwr,\" started burning properties in December 1979, protesting the sale of homes in rural Wales as vacation homes to people from England. This group was associated with almost all of the fire-bombings incidents from the Llyn Peninsula to Pembrokeshire, which lasted until the early 1990s. Law enforcement faced accusations from some that they were unfairly targeting nationalists. Although one man, Sion Aubrey Roberts, was convicted of sending letter bombs in 1993, the arson cases are still unsolved.\n\nAs a solicitor, Elfyn Llwyd represented Bryn F&#244;n, a Welsh singer, when he was suspected of arson campaign involvement. F&#244;n was eventually released without any charges. Mr. Llwyd, now MP for Merionnydd Nant Conwy and Parliamentary Leader of Plaid Cymru, is claiming that security services, and not Meibion Glyndwr, may have participated in some of the terror attacks. He thinks some elements of the British security services might have carried out rogue actions to discredit Plaid Cymru and the nationalist vote before elections. This claim is part of an interview for the BBC Wales program Maniffesto, set to air on S4C.\n\nMr. Llwyd stated that many of the devices used in attacks were sophisticated compared to others, pointing to a level of skill only possessed by those who knew exactly what they were doing. He said their involvement was inappropriate, implying actions akin to an\nagent provocateur\n, creating a situation to make it seem like nationalists were responsible. Lord Roberts of Conwy, a Welsh Office minister during that time, also appeared on the program and denied any improper security service role. Dafydd Wigley, former President of Plaid Cymru, has also questioned Mr. Llwyd\u2019s theory. While acknowledging that the fires harmed Plaid Cymru's image, he believed security services were preoccupied with the IRA and animal rights activists at the time.\n\nThe Maniffesto program was scheduled to be broadcast on S4C on Sunday, December 12, at 1200 GMT.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 7370, "text": "This work introduces a fresh image segmentation approach utilizing sparse subset selection. The method commences with an excessive segmentation, then employs local spectral histogram attributes to transform the small segments' visual data into high-dimensional vectors, known as superpixel features. Subsequently, these features are input into a new convex model that effectively uses them to assemble the superpixels into an appropriate quantity of uniform regions. The model inherently identifies both the ideal count of uniform regions and the superpixel assignments needed to create the final segments. A numerical algorithm, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), is presented to resolve the model. This algorithm's iterations comprise two highly parallelizable sub-problems. Each sub-problem has a closed-form solution, making the ADMM iterations computationally effective. Thorough tests on standard image segmentation datasets reveal that the proposed method, along with an over-segmentation, offers excellent and comparable outcomes relative to other leading methods.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 7374, "text": "Tony Blair denied reports that he promised Gordon Brown he would resign before the upcoming election. The prime minister stated on BBC One that such positions aren't negotiated through deals. A recently published book, Brown's Britain, alleges that Blair reversed his promise to step aside for Brown following interventions from Cabinet allies in June 2004. Blair dismissed these allegations as old news and insisted his focus was on governing the country. Blair reiterated that job arrangements aren't made via deals and emphasized their joint focus on national issues. The book, written by Robert Peston, a Sunday Telegraph journalist and excerpted in the paper, describes a relationship defined by \"mutual animosity and contempt.\"\n\nThe book asserts that Tony Blair felt that he had lost the public's confidence because of the Iraq war by November of 2003, and that he was no longer beneficial to the Labour Party. It further claims that during a dinner hosted by John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, Blair told Brown about his plans to step down, saying, \"Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.\" However, the book alleges that Blair changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and because he suspected Brown of deliberately undermining him.\n\nPeston told BBC News that the two men are not as close or friendly as they once were. The book suggests there is now profound mutual distrust and animosity between them. Peston believes that while they publicly present a united front, their private relationship is strained because Brown feels betrayed, particularly regarding the leadership issue. In a broad-ranging BBC interview, Blair, addressing various topics including the Asian tsunami disaster, the Middle East peace process, and Northern Ireland, commented that high-level politics attracts numerous claims and counter-claims. He expressed frustration with the repeated allegations.\n\nRecent speculation about a rift emerged following separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumors were intensified when Blair scheduled his monthly media conference to coincide with a long-planned speech by Brown regarding UK plans for a new \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa to address global poverty. There was conjecture that they were trying to outperform each other in their responses to the disaster. However, the prime minister said that he had talked with the Chancellor about these claims and dismissed them as \"a load of nonsense\". Frank Field, a former welfare minister and MP, said that the prime minister should dismiss Brown, but that he did not believe Blair had the power to do so.\n\nMichael Howard, the Tory leader, accused Blair and Brown of acting childishly, asserting that Britain deserved better than \"the politics of the playground.\" Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman, stated that the personal ambitions of Blair and Brown were \"getting in the way of good government\". Taylor suggested that either they must overcome their disputes or the electorate would not support a divided government in the next election.

As examples, it is demonstrated that particular linear transformations, such as Stirling, Jacobi-Stirling, Legendre-Stirling, and central factorial transformations, preserve strong $q$-log-convexity (or log-convexity) in a consistent way. Specifically, a conjecture is proven, and certain findings about strong $q$-log-convexity and transformations preserving log-convexity are expanded upon. The property of stability in iterated polynomials leads to $q$-log-convexity. Using the interlacing of zeros technique, two criteria for the stability of iterated Sturm sequences and the $q$-log-convexity of polynomials are presented. As a result, the stabilities of iterated Eulerian polynomials of type $A$ and $B$, along with their $q$-analogs, are obtained. Furthermore, it is shown that the generating functions for alternating runs of types $A$ and $B$, the longest alternating subsequence, and up-down runs of permutations form a $q$-log-convex sequence.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This proposition, tied to a commerce agreement between the two nations, would let China manage Venezuelan oil fields and put money into additional refining facilities. Venezuela also proposed providing China with a monthly supply of 120,000 barrels of fuel oil. Venezuela, a major global oil exporter, directs a large portion of its oil exports to the United States. The Venezuelan government, experiencing a difficult relationship with the United States, aims to broaden its sales channels to lessen its reliance on its primary export destination.\n\nChina's rapidly expanding economy's requirement for petroleum, alongside geopolitical volatility in the Middle East and logistical limitations, has played a part in record-breaking oil prices this year. Oil prices are completing the year significantly higher than at the start of the previous year.\n\nReports from the Ministry of Commerce anticipate China's oil imports to increase considerably this year. China has been acquiring more oil than it produces since the mid-1990s, with a notable percentage of its oil and gas consumption originating from international sources. A deficit in domestic production and the motivation to reduce dependence on imports from the Middle East has guided China to explore investment opportunities in alternative markets like Latin America. The Venezuelan president stated that his nation would make its oil infrastructure available to China. He verified that Chinese companies would have the opportunity to oversee a set of established oil fields in eastern Venezuela with the potential to yield over one billion barrels.

{"id": 7402, "text": "I resided at Arthur's dwelling during a happy and glorious time. His court was in a place unnamed and distinct from familiar locations. Despite its obscurity, it was a blissful setting. The downfall of Britain was distant then. A destructive love existed, appearing harmless and lacking the signs of the doom it would bring. The narrator apologizes for their rambling due to age and reminisces about a past request to tell a story. The narrator then describes a summer hunting expedition from Arthur's court, with the party eventually dismounting near a fountain within a unique grove.\n\nThe place was idyllic. They were delighted to be there, but they discovered a man near the fountain, his horse grazing nearby. Gawain approached the man, who arose and identified himself while greeting the king and queen. He also acknowledged Lancelot and Gawain. He cleverly declined to be labeled as just a name, but as a result of accomplishments. The Queen inquired if he had performed any acts of chivalry. He said he was young and had only heard her name and sang praises. The King requested a tale, recognizing the man was neither foolish nor low. The man explained his lineage, stating that his family was royal but in decline and near ruin. He offered the King a simple meal and wine. Arthur intended to reply with kind words, but the man quickly departed.\n\nThe King felt cheerful, anticipating a tale from the past. Guinevere dismounted as well, and they relaxed under the trees enjoying the beautiful day and the calming calm. A group emerged: a forester, two maidens with chaplets and golden chains, and two varlets leading a wagon drawn by oxen. The wagon contained wine, bread, and meat, and a man in old, plain attire wearing a crown and a large sword sat on a golden cloth. Arthur admired the sword, reminded of Excalibur. The forest youth returned, explaining his grandfather wished to see Arthur and that the people with him were the youth's family and that they were bringing food and drink.\n\nThe youth's father knelt before Arthur, who was surprised by a gold ring he wore and the beauty of the kneeling sisters. All thought these folk were finer. The grandfather did not kneel but greeted Arthur warmly. Arthur was delighted. They sat together, and the grandfather commented on Arthur's excellence as king and stated that although not related and of a higher rank, he supported Arthur. He claimed to be blessed or cursed with visions of the future, seeing both glory and tragedy in Arthur's life. He was confident that Arthur would confront both. The old man stopped, and Arthur proclaimed his ability to know the future from the past and the living from the dead.\n\nThe elder looked wisely at Arthur. Guinevere felt a mixture of fear and love, while Lancelot felt a similar pain. The elder turned to Guinevere, and with great sweetness the Queen realized he could read her story. He told her to be happy that day because she was in his ancestors' house and he told of what used to be there, including a stream running through their hall. He brandished the sword and shook it over his knee. Guenevere asked to see it, and Lancelot moved closer to look upon the treasure close. The elder warned that the sword's appearance would be like the sun rising during Ragnarok, on a day he would not see.\n\nHe smiled and placed Guinevere's hand on the sword, claiming her hand was worthy. He identified the sword as Tyrfing, an ancient blade, and showed the peace strings, saying it was so that the sword would not be drawn unintentionally. Arthur joked that such a sword would not be put away unsatisfied. He praised the feast and requested a tale of Tyrfing. The elder agreed to share a tale of the past while they dined. They ate amidst the fair woods, and it seemed the world had changed.\n\nThe Queen filled a cup, drank to the memories of the man's ancestors, and asked him to tell a tale of their deeds. He laughed and said to keep the peace strings whole for today. He said the drink made his heart recall the first true love that brought his family to prominence, a tale as told by his grandmother. She said that long ago the land was rougher, the trees were different, and the people were unlike them. Bears were more plentiful, and dealing with wolves was difficult. There were tales of fearsome creatures and shapes that were not men. Fairies roamed, and treasure flames flickered on graves.\n\nShe said that people who could overcome the fears of earth in those days were likely noble. She said that if you could see those who lived in those woods you would see cousins of the Gods of old. The story tells of a Goodman's son, twenty years old, fair, strong, and supple. One day in June, he ventured through the woods and emerged upon this very place. He had been hunting and sought rest by the stream. He found a blue and white pavilion, with many armed people and horses.\n\nThe youth questioned whether it was best to flee, but his curiosity was sparked. He thought he might be seeing the Gods. He knew that they might like to display their finery. He also was taught that those wise knew no fear. So he shouldered his kill, a roe, and went forth. Those at the camp greeted him well, but he was dressed in a sheep skin, quiver on his back and knife on his thigh, with an unstrung bow. He also wore a frown on his face as he saw the swords and spears of the men, who cried out for him to halt.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"then you are no Gods, so fear not, I shall not make war.\" He threw down his knife. They laughed and one sheathed his sword, \"Thanks, army leader, for that word! We are not Gods e'en as thou say'st, Nor thou a devil of the waste But e'en a devil's a friend belike.\" Hate began to fill the woodsman's heart but he spoke softly, \"What men are ye and where dwell ye? What is the wondrous house I see?\" \"In the fair southland is our home Yet from the north as now we come,\" Said one: then with a mocking smile, \"And in our house there dwells awhile A very Goddess of the north. But lo you, take a thing of worth For that thy quarry, and begone.\"\n\nAs he spoke another whispered in his ear, and the word spread, laughing.

This paper addresses the distributed reconstruction of a time-varying bandlimited graph signal from sampled observations at some nodes. A distributed least square reconstruction (DLSR) algorithm is introduced to iteratively recover the signal by enabling neighboring nodes to communicate and quickly update. DLSR employs a decay method to eliminate out-of-band energy that emerges during reconstruction due to transmission delays in distributed systems. The paper includes convergence proofs and error limits for DLSR, indicating its capacity to track time-varying graph signals and reconstruct time-invariant signals perfectly. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world sensor network data are conducted to demonstrate the DLSR algorithm's ability to track slowly time-varying graph signals.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 7422, "text": "Researchers are exploring methods to extend laptop battery life to cover a full workday. Industry insiders suggest that fresh battery chemical formulas could significantly increase power capacity. Modifications range from laptop chip manufacturing techniques to methods that lessen display energy use. Since their creation, users have been bothered by how long laptops last between charges.\nA study in 2000 showed that short battery life was the most frequent complaint regarding laptops. An executive at Intel stated that the main focus previously was on performance and features. He added that for most of the 90s, battery life remained at approximately two to two and a half hours. However, laptops can now function for longer durations. Enhancing battery life involves more than simply extracting additional power from lithium-ion batteries. Other changes are necessary to achieve the goal of laptops operating for about eight hours before needing to be recharged. Lithium-ion technology alone won't suffice. The executive stated that the industry has done a good job of maximizing the energy storage capacity of the technology. New battery chemistries hold promise for packing more power into the same volume, though further development is needed to successfully transition them from laboratory to production. The executive expressed skepticism about the rapid development of fuel cells as replacements for solid batteries, despite their potential to generate several times more energy than lithium-ion power packs. Fuel cells need pumps, separators, and evaporation chambers.\nIntel is collaborating with component manufacturers to assess energy consumption in laptops and find ways to reduce power demands. This effort has led to a working group that shares information on developing notebooks with reduced power consumption. Decreasing the size of chip components contributes to lower power usage. Intel has also altered its method of creating transistors on silicon to diminish their power needs. Improvements in voltage regulator manufacturing can reduce heat-related power loss and enhance a notebook's energy efficiency. Additionally, research is being conducted on reducing display energy consumption, as it currently consumes the most power in a laptop. A number of laptop makers are aiming to create screens that require only three watts of power. The executive said that getting close to eight hours would be extraordinarily valuable and is what the industry needs to provide.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The program has disbursed a certain amount of money over a period of time, with a particular sum available for a certain year.\n\nMs. Cooper stated that the planning system currently has major problems regarding locations for nomadic people. She said that local authorities are not identifying enough suitable locations for either private or public sites, and they lack sufficient power to quickly address construction on inappropriate sites. She added that this results in too many developments on unsuitable locations, causing stress and difficulties for both the neighboring communities and the nomadic people, and that this is why they are consulting on a new requirement for local authorities to identify more suitable locations, as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment. Under the new regulations, expected to be in force at a certain time, officials will be able to issue \"temporary stop notices\" aimed at preventing works on a site before a local governing body has had chance to obtain a full legal ban.

At eight years old, her mother enrolled her in ballet lessons due to concerns about her flat feet and weak legs, a decision that would significantly alter her life. Her talent quickly became evident. Sergei Diaghilev, a Russian artistic director, noticed her and desired for her to dance in his company, Ballets Russes. She contracted diphtheria but maintained contact and eventually joined Diaghilev in Monte Carlo at 14, accompanied by a governess.\n\nFrom there, she toured Europe, performing in prestigious venues. Diaghilev renamed her without consulting her. Her life was full of excitement. Figures like Matisse and Stravinsky became like family to her, with Stravinsky overseeing her musical education. Following Diaghilev's death in 1929, Alicia Markova returned to England and became Britain's first international ballerina. She contributed to the establishment of the Ballet Club at the Mercury Theatre (later Ballet Rambert), the Vic Wells Ballet, and the Markova-Dolin Ballet of 1935-37 with Anton Dolin. She also began collaborating with emerging choreographers such as Anthony Tudor and Frederick Ashton, who greatly influenced ballet's direction in the West.\n\nHer rendition of Giselle, characterized by lightness and grace, is still regarded as one of the best ever. She also excelled in The Dying Swan. She was among the first British ballerinas to play a significant role in Les Sylphides. Above all, she helped to popularize ballet in both Britain and America.\n\nDuring World War II, Alicia Markova resided in the United States, where she performed for large audiences in a re-formed Ballets Russes. She even appeared in Hollywood films. In 1950, she and Anton Dolin co-founded the Festival Ballet back in England. She retired in 1963, a decision she described as \"instant\" and \"largely because of a leg injury.\" After being made a Dame, she started a new career as a teacher. She also traveled the world, directing ballet companies and staging productions. She became the director of ballet for the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in New York and served as a full-time Professor of Ballet and Performing Arts at the University of Cincinnati for several years.

Certain consumer organizations have communicated worries about the possibility that these tags could be used to keep track of customers even after they have left stores with their bought items. The survey indicated that understanding of these tags amongst European consumers was minimal. The consultancy group Capgemini conducted the survey of consumers in the Netherlands, Germany, France, and the UK. The company supports over 30 organizations that are trying to encourage the expansion of RFID technology. Each item contains a unique identification number in the tags, which are a mix of computer chips and antennae that scanners can read. More than half (55%) of those who responded expressed concern or great concern that RFID tags could enable businesses to monitor customers using product purchases. According to fifty-nine percent of people surveyed, they feared that RFID tags would allow third parties to use data with more ease. According to Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini's principal consultant on RFID, the survey findings showed retailers need to inform and teach the public about RFID before it gains acceptance. He added that acceptance of new technology occurs when customers start to think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The industry, he claims, can reach this point with ongoing communication and the right RFID strategy. He also added that the survey showed people would accept RFID if they thought it could reduce car theft or allow for quicker recovery of stolen goods.

{"id": 7438, "text": "The prologue is written by the made-up author Sieur Louis de Conte, who is writing to his family from Domr\u00e9my, France in 1492. He says that he was Joan's childhood friend, then her assistant. He remembers being with her \"from the beginning until the end.\" Book One starts with de Conte's birth on January 6, 1410, in Neufch\u00e2teau, France. He talks about how his early life was filled with suffering because of the English army. He says that France has been struggling against the English and Burgundian armies for over seventy-five years. The French people are becoming more and more hopeless as they lose battles. In 1415, de Conte's family is killed by a Burgundian raiding party, and he is sent to live with the priest in Domr\u00e9my. There, he meets young Joan d'Arc, who lives a peaceful life in the small village. Even when she was young, de Conte says that Joan was the wisest and bravest child in Domr\u00e9my, giving examples such as defending the fairies against unfair banishment, persuading the townspeople to give food and shelter to a homeless soldier, and calmly stopping a dangerous man who was threatening the village. Chapter VI says that when Joan was fourteen, she changed from being \"the most light-hearted creature and the merriest in the village\" to being \"mainly grave.\" In the next chapter, a year and a half later, de Conte learns why she is acting so serious. On May 15, 1428, Joan reveals that she has been visited by saints and angels. She says that God has chosen her \"to lead His armies, and win back France, and set the crown upon the head of His servant that is Dauphin and shall be King.\" Joan is hesitant at first, saying, \"I am only a child; a child and ignorant \u2013 ignorant of everything that pertains to war.\" Book Two's final chapters, VII and VIII, describe the problems Joan faces in carrying out her mission, starting when the governor of Vaucoleurs refuses to give her a group of soldiers. Book Two begins with the removal of Joan's obstacles. de Conte says that Joan, following the advice of her Voices, remains determined in her mission and begins her journey to the Dauphin on February 23, accompanied by an escort. In Chapter VI, Joan arrives at the Castle of Chinon, ready to fulfill her mission and speak to the future king. However, before letting her in, the Dauphin tests Joan by trading his royal clothes with those of a commoner. Joan is not fooled by the trick and recognizes the real king-to-be. After receiving another sign from Joan, the Dauphin is convinced that her mission is from God and appoints her as General of the Armies of France. In Chapter X, Joan begins to plan her campaign, writing a letter to the English commanders at Orleans, demanding that they leave France. She also establishes order among her troops, banning prostitution, gambling, and requiring that \"every man who joins my standard must confess before the priest\u2026and all accepted recruits must be present at divine service twice a day.\" de Conte describes the army's march across France, starting at Orleans and winning many battles. He says that Joan's Voices stay with her throughout the campaign, guiding and encouraging her. On one occasion, in Chapter XXI, Joan's Voices reveal that she will be shot by an arrow on May 7, between her neck and shoulder. The prophecy comes true the next day in the exact way it was described. Two chapters later, after a victory at Tours, the novel says that Joan is given the Dauphin's permission to march on Rheims. Once again, every English stronghold in her path is taken back. de Conte is amazed that the French have the advantage in the Hundred Years' War for the first time in ninety-one years. On July 5, the English forces at Rheims surrender, allowing Charles to be crowned. However, even with this accomplishment, Joan refuses to stop her campaign. In Chapter XXVIII, Joan is allowed to march on Paris, saying that if they are successful, it would cripple the English forces. But, with a victory at Paris in sight, the King declares that the campaign is over. Instead, he makes a truce to leave Paris unthreatened. de Conte complains, \"Joan of Arc, who had never been defeated by the enemy, was defeated by her own King.\" In the final chapter, de Conte says sadly that Joan is taken prisoner by the Burgundians on May 24, 1430, while attacking a small force at Marguy. The third and final book begins with Joan d'Arc's imprisonment at Marguy. The Burgundians hold Joan for five and a half months while waiting for King Charles to pay a ransom of 61,125 francs. When no one tries to pay, she is sold to the English. Joan remains imprisoned for two more months while her enemies, led by Bishop Pierre Cauchon of Beauvais, prepare her trial. They decide that Joan must be tried by priests for crimes against religion in order to weaken her influence over the French people. de Conte mocks the English's methods of \"raking and scraping everywhere for any odds and ends of evidence or suspicion or conjecture that might be made usable against Joan.\" Starting in Chapter IV, the novel gives a detailed account of Joan's three-month-long trial, which begins on February 21, 1431. de Conte, secretly working as a clerk for the chief recorder, describes the trial as unfair in many ways. \"Fifty experts against a novice,\" he says, \"and no one to help the novice!\" de Conte also includes an official transcript that says, \"They asked her profound questions\u2026the questioners changed suddenly and passes to another subject to see if she would not contradict herself.\" Yet, despite this, Joan is praised for answering the questions bravely. de Conte says that many people in the courtroom were amazed by the wisdom and prudence of her answers. Chapter VII tells the story of her most famous answer after Beaupere asks her, \"Are you in a state of Grace.\" de Conte says that she answers with simple seriousness, \"If I be not in a state of Grace, I pray God place me in it; if I be in it, I pray God keep me so.\" Yet, in Chapter XX, after being imprisoned for almost three months, Joan finally gives in to her captors. Joan, unable to read it, signs a document \"confessing herself a sorceress, a dealer with devils, a liar, a blasphemer of God and His angels\u2026and this signature of hers bound her to resume the dress of a woman.\" However, in Chapter XXII, de Conte accuses the English of treachery, saying, \"While Joan slept, in the early morning of Sunday, one of the guards stole her female apparel and put her male attire in its place\u2026she saw that she could not save her life if she must fight for it against treacheries like this; so she put on the forbidden garments, knowing what the end would be.\" For breaking the condition, Joan is sentenced to be burned at the stake on the following Wednesday, May 30, 1431. The final chapter, XXIV, recounts Joan's last few hours before she is burned, but not the execution itself. In his writing, de Conte returns to the present year of 1492, where he is eighty-two years old. He summarizes the lives and deaths of many of the characters, including Joan's family and King Charles VII. He ends with a tribute to Joan's legacy, mentioning her impact on the country she loved so much.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Hominems are more intelligent, stronger, faster, more resilient to illness and trauma, and possess quicker reflexes. Their senses of sight, hearing, and smell are also superior. At the start of the story, Candy has completed high school and some college, and has earned a Fifth Degree Black Belt in karate from her 73-year-old neighbor, Soo Kim McDivot, who Candy believes is simply a retired teacher. McDivot, called \"Teacher\" by Candy, is actually the discoverer of the H. post hominem species and is mentoring and leading a group of them, called the AAs. Candy's karate training has included learning to unleash hysterical strength, allowing brief periods of nearly superhuman activity. As international tensions escalate, Candy's father, publicly a pathologist in a small town but secretly a government biowarfare expert, is summoned to Washington, D.C., leaving Candy at home. The next day, a global attack employing a bionuclear plague almost entirely eliminates humanity (Homo sapiens). Candy survives the attack in the shelter beneath her home with her pet bird Terry, a Hyacinthine macaw she considers her \"lifelong retarded, adopted twin brother,\" who often \"parrots\" her words before she speaks them. Three months later, she emerges, learns about her genetic background, and starts looking for others like her. Her search first leads her to \"Adam,\" a witty and multitalented 13-year-old boy who immediately tries to win Candy's affections, then to Rollo Jones, a middle-aged doctor with extensive wilderness survival experience, from Peace Corps service to mountain climbing, and finally to Kim Mellon, a computer engineer in her early twenties, and her six-year-old daughter, Lisa. Rollo reveals himself to be a sociopath, whom Candy must kill in self-defense and to protect Terry. Adam, Kim, and Lisa join Candy's pursuit of the AA community. During the search, Adam reveals his skill as an ultralight aircraft pilot, and he later teaches Candy to fly. An ultralight engine failure then separates Candy from the others. After restarting the engine, she sees a contrail leading her to Vandenberg Space Shuttle Launch Complex, where Teacher and the AAs are preparing a shuttle, renamed the Nathan Hale, for launch. They have identified the Bratstvo, translated as the \"Brotherhood,\" a group of H. sapiens within the Russian military, as responsible for wiping out mankind, seeking to destroy all H. post hominems. They have also placed a doomsday device in geosynchronous orbit, a Strontium-90 bomb which will render the planet uninhabitable for 200 years. The AAs' plan to reach geosynchronous orbit using a modified Hale is a one-way, suicide mission for the crew. However, the miniature robot designed to disarm the bomb inside the warhead-carrying rocket is inadequate for the task. Candy, due to her small size and training in hysterical strength, realizes she is the only one who can enter the warhead chamber and disarm the bomb. Despite the mission's suicidal nature, she volunteers. Meanwhile, as Adam, Kim, and Lisa search for Candy, Terry begins to communicate her thoughts, though they initially don't recognize it. Arriving in orbit, Kyril Svetlanov, believed to be a Bratstvo defector, kills Harris Gilbert, the mission commander. Kyril is revealed to be a double agent tasked with sabotaging the mission, but he is unaware of Candy's karate skills. She breaks his neck and takes over the mission. Wearing a spacesuit, she navigates to the bomb-carrying rocket and disables the warhead. Then she resets the navigational computer to land on the dry lake at Edwards Air Force Base and braces herself against a bulkhead for the stresses of reentry. As the missile prepares for reentry, Adam realizes Terry is relaying Candy's thoughts and that she is in space, about to reenter in a vehicle not designed for humans, and will soon land at Edwards. He, Kim, and Lisa arrive as the missile lands, rescuing her, resuscitating her, and treating her injuries.

{"id": 7455, "text": "A study on online search behavior indicates that those who utilize search engines exhibit a combination of expertise and inexperience. The US Pew Research Center's study shows that most users, 87%, locate what they need using search engines. However, only a few can differentiate between paid and unpaid results. Eighty-four percent of internet users regularly use Google, Ask Jeeves, MSN, and Yahoo.\n\nAlmost half of the participants reported that their confidence in search engines would diminish if they suspected that information about payment for results was concealed. The average user, according to Pew researchers, spends approximately 43 minutes each month conducting 34 searches, examining roughly 1.9 webpages per search. Thirty-six percent of online users search at least once a week, while 29% search less often. For 44% of those surveyed, the data they are trying to locate is essential to their activities.\n\nSearch engine users are generally loyal, frequently sticking with a familiar and reliable site. Forty-four percent of searchers rely on a single search engine, 48% use two or three, and 7% consult more than three. Ask Jeeves spokesman, Tony Macklin, said that their research mirrored these results, showing that users employ different search engines for varied results to the same queries due to differing data collection methods. Despite this preference for search sites, 50% of those questioned stated they could find similar information elsewhere. Seventeen percent stated they would not miss search engines, while 33% considered them essential. Over two-thirds, 68%, felt that their search results were an equitable, impartial compilation of web data on a topic. Alongside growing user proficiency is a general unawareness regarding paid search results. Sixty-two percent of participants didn't realize some search results are paid advertisements. Only 18% can tell the difference between paid and unpaid results. The Pew report noted the irony that nearly half of all users would cease using search engines if they thought paid results were being presented ambiguously. Mr. Macklin commented that sponsored results need clear labeling, and while they can be helpful, user testing shows that people need to distinguish between them.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

A unique partially-supervised learning process is created that takes advantage of many unsegmented images along with a few images segmented by hand by specialists, to make pixel-by-pixel flow between two points in time of a 2D plus time MRI movie. By putting together these flow maps and heart segmentation masks, we find a local flow that represents the 2D motion of the heart muscle and chambers. This results in sequences of the radius and thickness of heart muscle sections to stand for heart movement. These movement feature sequences are trustworthy and understandable characteristics of heart disease movement. In addition, they are put together with features related to form to categorize heart diseases. Using only nine feature values as input, we introduce an understandable, uncomplicated, and adaptable model for categorizing disease. The model reaches 95% and 94% categorization precision on both a training and testing set. Its ability is therefore about the same as the most advanced.

The Major had once saved the Royalist's life, and Lady Peveril had raised his daughter, Alice, alongside her own son. After the Restoration, the Countess of Derby sought refuge at Martindale Castle. Bridgenorth intended to arrest her, but the knight intervened, helping her return to the Isle of Man. Alice was then taken from Lady Peveril's care, and the Major was thought to have moved to New England. Years later, Geoffrey's son, Julian, became close to the young earl and rekindled his relationship with Alice, who was being cared for by her widowed aunt. During one of their secret meetings, her father appeared, speaking of his religious beliefs and hinting at the possibility of their marriage.\n\nThe following night, Julian agreed to travel to London to clear the countess and her son of suspicion in the Popish plot. Fenella, his patron's deaf and dumb dwarf, led him to a ship. While he slept, she was taken ashore against her will, and he dreamt of Alice calling for his help. In Liverpool, he encountered Topham with a warrant for Sir Geoffrey's arrest. On his way to warn his father, he traveled with Edward Christian, disguised as a priest. Christian led him to an inn where they dined with Chiffinch, a servant of Charles II. Arriving at Martindale Castle, Julian found his parents in the custody of Roundheads and was taken prisoner by Bridgenorth to Moultrassie Hall, where Alice was present. He recognized Christian among the Puritan visitors.\n\nDuring the night, the Hall was attacked, and Julian, now free, began searching for his parents with Lance as his servant. He discovered they were being taken to London by Topham. At an inn, he overheard Chiffinch discussing a plot against Alice and that he had been robbed of papers entrusted to him by the countess, which he later retrieved. Meanwhile, Christian, who was entrusted with Alice's care by Bridgenorth, revealed to the Duke of Buckingham his plan to introduce her to Charles II. In a meeting with her father, Christian tried to dissuade him from allowing her to marry young Peveril.\n\nUpon reaching London, Julian encountered Fenella, who led him to St. James's Park. There, her dancing caught the king's attention, and he sent them to Chiffinch's apartments. Alice was already there, under Mistress Chiffinch's care. She escaped an interview with the duke only to find herself in the presence of Charles and Julian, with whom she was allowed to leave after Julian placed the countess's papers in the king's hands. However, Julian lost her in a street fight and was imprisoned in Newgate for wounding his attacker. There, he shared a cell with the queen's dwarf and spoke with an unseen person.\n\nAfter shocking Christian with news of his niece's disappearance, the duke bribed Colonel Blood to prevent Christian from finding her whereabouts. The duke was then surprised to find Fenella instead of Alice, who had been captured by his servants in his house, and at her defiance and escape. Some days after, Geoffrey Peveril, his son, and the dwarf were tried for aiding the Oates's Plot, but they were acquitted. To avoid the crowd, they hid in a room, where they met Bridgenorth. He convinced Julian they were in his power and allowed Christian to propose to the Duke of Buckingham that hundreds of Fifth-Monarchy men, led by Colonel Blood, seize the king, and proclaim his Grace Lord-Lieutenant of the kingdom. That afternoon, Charles was granting an audience to the Countess of Derby when the dwarf revealed the conspiracy, which Fenella had overheard, from a violoncello case.\n\nIt came to light that Bridgenorth had freed the Peverils, and Christian had trained his daughter Fenella, whose real name was Zarah, to pretend to be deaf and dumb so that she could act as his spy, but her secret love for Julian had prevented his revenge against the countess. Christian was allowed to leave the country, and Bridgenorth, after recovering Alice with Fenella's assistance, placed her under Lady Peveril's care. He then offered to return some of Sir Geoffrey's land that had come into his possession as her dowry.

{"id": 7480, "text": "Nigeria's government plans to significantly increase cocoa output within three years through a new initiative. The Agriculture Minister stated that the goal is to raise production from the current estimate of 180,000 tonnes to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will invest 154 million naira in farming subsidies. Nigeria is currently the fourth largest cocoa producer worldwide.\n\nCocoa was Nigeria's primary export in the 1960s. However, with the rise of oil, the government shifted its focus away from cocoa, causing production to decline from its 1970 peak of about 400,000 tonnes per year. During the program's launch in Ibadan, the Minister explained that a further objective is to promote domestic cocoa processing and increase local consumption. He also revealed that 91 million naira has been allocated to establish cocoa nurseries. Nigeria might be trying to imitate Ghana's success, which had a record cocoa harvest the previous year. Some farmers, however, expressed doubt about the proposals. One cocoa farmer claimed that non-farmers would exploit the subsidy and that rural farmers never receive assistance.\n\nConcurrently with Nigeria's announcement, Ghana reported record revenues from the cocoa industry. The country exported over $1.2 billion worth of cocoa beans during 2003-04. Experts attributed this success to advanced production methods and crop spraying implemented by the government, which boosted production to levels reminiscent of the 1960s when Ghana was the world's top cocoa producer.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Olly Barkley, a Bath centre, is also possibly injured, as he was absent from Saturday's game because of a leg injury. Barkley is scheduled for a scan on Sunday, which will determine whether he can play against Ireland the following weekend in the Six Nations. Andy Robinson, the coach, has already seen the team lose their first two Six Nations matches of 2005, and this is another setback. Jonny Wilkinson, Will Greenwood, Mike Tindall, Richard Hill, and Trevor Woodman, all World Cup winners, are also unavailable because of injuries. The specific bone broken in Vickery's forearm is the radius. He had just rejoined the England team the previous weekend, following a lengthy absence caused by a back injury and then a fractured eye socket. Vickery's return to the team was triggered by an injury to Leicester tight-head Julian White, who has already been declared unable to play in the Ireland game due to a neck injury.\n\nMatt Stevens, a Bath prop, is the only remaining tight-head prop in England's training squad and might participate in the Ireland match. However, he is usually second to Duncan Bell at the club level, who did very well for England A against France and could be called up to the squad. The severity of Barkley's injury is still unknown, but Bath's coach, John Connolly, believes his chances of playing against Ireland are no more than \"50-50\". Barkley played inside centre in England's loss to France, and if he is unable to play, the midfield will need to be changed once again.\n\nRobinson may decide to recall Mathew Tait or Henry Paul, but Tait had a difficult game for Newcastle against Leicester on Saturday, and Paul left the game against Bath with an ankle injury. Ollie Smith, an in-form Leicester centre, is another strong contender, and his two tries against Newcastle are likely to have improved his chances.
