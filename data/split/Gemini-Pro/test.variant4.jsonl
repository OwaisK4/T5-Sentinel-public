rather, our senses and minds perceive things in relation to ourselves, distorting reality by mixing it with our own nature.\n\nxlii.\nidols of the cave are individual biases; each person has a \"cave\" that distorts natural light due to their unique nature, upbringing, interactions, reading, admired authorities, or state of mind, thus, human perception varies and is subject to chance; heraclitus noted that people search for knowledge within their own limited perspectives instead of in the broader world.\n\nxliii.\nidols of the market-place arise from human interaction and language, as words are created and used based on common understanding. flawed word choices hinder comprehension, and even scholarly attempts to clarify don't solve the problem; words often dominate understanding, leading to pointless arguments and fantasies.\n\nxliv.\nidols of the theatre stem from philosophical dogmas and flawed reasoning methods; i see established systems as staged plays presenting artificial worlds, and this applies not only to current and ancient systems, but also to potential future ones because very different errors can arise from similar causes. the term applies to entire systems and to principles and axioms received through tradition, gullibility, and carelessness. these idols will be discussed in detail to properly caution the understanding.\n\nxlv.\nthe human mind instinctively imposes more order and regularity on the world than actually exists. despite nature\u2019s irregularities, we invent parallels and connections where none exist, like presuming perfect circular orbits or creating an element of fire to complete a symmetrical system. these biases affect not only beliefs but also fundamental concepts.\n\nxlvi.\nonce the mind adopts an opinion, it interprets everything to support it, ignoring or dismissing contradictory evidence to maintain its original conclusions, a phenomenon seen in superstitions where fulfilled events are noted and failures are overlooked. this bias subtly infiltrates philosophy and science, where initial conclusions shape subsequent ones, regardless of their soundness. affirmative instances unduly sway the intellect more than negative ones, but negative instances are more important for establishing axioms.\n\nxlvii.\nthe human intellect is most affected by immediate and striking things, assuming other things are similar, even without proof; it avoids the effort of exploring diverse instances needed to test axioms unless forced by strict methods.\n\nxlviii.\nthe restless human mind cannot stop searching, leading to unprovable concepts like the world having a limit, or eternity flowing to the present; distinctions between past and future infinity are flawed, as they suggest one infinity is larger and that infinity can diminish; the mind's inability to stop also causes problems in finding causes, as it seeks ultimate causes even for fundamental principles, which should simply be accepted as they are, leading to reliance on final causes related to human nature rather than the universe's; however, it is as poor to seek a cause for what is general as to not do so for lesser things.\n\nxlix.\nthe human understanding is influenced by will and emotion, creating biased sciences. we more readily believe what we prefer to be true, rejecting difficult things due to impatience, sober ideas due to their limiting nature, deep natural concepts from superstition, and practical experience out of arrogance, and beliefs differing from popular opinion due to deference. emotions subtly affect understanding in countless ways.\n\nl.\nthe senses' limitations cause the greatest distortions to understanding. immediate sensations outweigh less obvious but more important information, so observation stops where sight ends. hidden processes within tangible bodies and minute changes in substances go unnoticed; however, these must be explored to advance practical achievements in nature. furthermore, the nature of air and less dense substances is largely unknown. senses alone are unreliable, and improved sensory instruments offer limited help; true interpretation of nature requires appropriate instances and experiments where senses judge only the experiment, and the experiment reveals natural facts.\n\nli.\nthe human understanding tends to abstract and give substance to fleeting concepts. it is more helpful to dissect nature into parts than to abstract it, as democritus\u2019s school did. focus should be on matter, its arrangement, changes, simple actions, and laws of motion, because forms are mental constructs, unless laws of action are considered forms.\n\nlii.\nthe idols of the tribe stem from the uniform nature of the human spirit, its biases, limitations, restlessness, influence of emotions, sensory shortcomings, and manner of perception.\n\nliii.\nidols of the cave stem from individual mental and physical traits and from upbringing, habits, and chance. many exist, but i will discuss the most important for cautioning the understanding.\n\nliv.\npeople become attached to particular sciences because they believe they invented them or have devoted significant effort to them. when turning to philosophy, they skew it to fit their prior beliefs, exemplified by aristotle making natural philosophy subservient to logic, and chemists building fantastic philosophies from limited furnace experiments; similarly, gilbert created an entire system based on the study of magnets.\n\nlv.\na key difference between minds in science is that some readily note differences, while others note similarities. the precise mind focuses on subtle distinctions, while the broad mind finds general connections; both can err by focusing too much on fine points or superficial resemblances.\n\nlvi.\nsome excessively admire the past, while others crave novelty, with few finding a balance; this harms science by making judgments based on preference rather than seeking truth in eternal nature and experience. these biases should be rejected to prevent undue influence on the intellect.\n\nlvii.\nconcentrating on nature or simple forms disrupts the understanding, while considering composite forms overwhelms it; this is seen in the difference between the school of democritus, which focused on particles to the exclusion of structure, and other philosophies that admired structure and failed to examine simplicity; contemplation should alternate between these to make the understanding both penetrating and comprehensive and avoid the pitfalls mentioned.\n\nlviii.\nprovide prudence and contemplation to avoid idols of the cave, which mostly arise from favoring a subject, excessive comparison or distinction, partiality for certain times, or object sizes. students of nature should suspect whatever they enjoy most, being careful to keep their understanding even and clear.\n\nlix.\nidols of the market-place, entering understanding through language, are the most troublesome. people believe reason governs words, but words also influence understanding, making science sophistical and inactive. words, formed by common people, follow obvious lines of division. when a sharper mind seeks to adjust these lines to nature, words resist, resulting in debates about language, which mathematicians would better begin with, defining terms. definitions, however, don't solve the problem in material subjects because they use words, and a return to specific instances in series is needed, as i will explain in the method for forming concepts and axioms.\n\nlx.\nidols imposed by language are of two types: names for nonexistent things (from fantasy), and names for existing things that are confused and poorly defined. examples of the first are fortune, prime mover, and element of fire, born of false theories. these idols are easily removed by rejecting all theories as obsolete. the second type, stemming from faulty abstraction, is more complex; consider \"humid,\" used for things that spread, are indeterminate, yield, divide, unite, flow, cling, or liquefy. flame, air, dust, or glass may be humid, depending on the sense of the word, showing that the notion comes from a poorly verified abstraction of water and liquids. there are levels of distortion in words. names of substances, particularly well-defined low species, are least faulty, actions are more faulty, and qualities are most faulty (except for direct sensory perceptions); in all cases, more varied human senses yield better notions.\n\nlxi.\nidols of the theatre aren't innate or secret; they enter the mind openly from philosophical systems and distorted demonstration rules. refuting them is inconsistent, as we disagree on principles and demonstrations, which preserves the ancients' honor, as the issue is the way, not the ability, and the more active and swift one is in a wrong way, the further one goes astray. my method leaves little to the intellect, leveling all minds; like drawing a straight line with a rule instead of freehand, my plan relies less on skill. while detailed refutations are useless, i must discuss the sects, their signs of unsoundness, and the causes of misfortune and lasting agreement in error, to ease the path to truth and encourage the understanding to dismiss idols.\n\nlxii.\nthere are many idols of the theatre, and more are possible. if religion and civil governments hadn't discouraged new ideas, many philosophical sects like those among the greeks would have arisen. just as many hypotheses can be formed about the heavens, so can many dogmas be established in philosophy. in this philosophical theater, stories are more compact and elegant than real ones, and philosophy is based on either many things out of few, or little out of many, so it's based on too narrow a foundation of experiment and natural history and decides on too few cases. the rational school takes common instances from experience, vaguely ascertained and examined, and leaves the rest to wit. another class carefully experiments on a few things and constructs systems, forcing other facts to fit. a third mixes philosophy with theology, some seeking the origin of sciences among spirits, so this parent stock of errors - this false philosophy - is sophistical, empirical, and superstitious.\n\nlxiii.\naristotle exemplifies the first class, corrupting natural philosophy with logic, forming the world from categories, giving the soul a genus from second-intention words, explaining density with act and power, asserting single bodies have single motion, and imposing restrictions, being more concerned with answering and affirming than with inner truth, best shown when compared with other greek systems, which have some savor of nature, experience, and bodies, while aristotle's physics only use logical words, which are handled again in his metaphysics. although his books deal with experiments, he concluded before consulting experience, which he bends to fit his will, making him more guilty than the schoolmen who abandoned experience.\n\nlxiv.\nthe empirical school creates dogmas more deformed than the sophistical because it is based on narrow experiments instead of common notions. such a philosophy seems probable to those constantly involved with the experiments, and incredible to others. the alchemists and gilbert exemplify this. however, if my warnings rouse men to experiment and abandon sophistical doctrines, there may be danger from this type of philosophy, against which we should prepare.\n\nlxv.\nsuperstition and theology widely corrupt philosophy, harming entire systems or parts. the human understanding is susceptible to imagination as well as common notions, with sophistical philosophy ensnaring and the fanciful type flattering and misleading. people have intellectual ambition, exemplified in pythagoras, and plato and his subtle school; it also appears in abstract forms, final causes, and first causes, omitting intermediate causes. caution is needed, as the apotheosis of error is mischievous, and vanity becoming venerated is a plague. some moderns have lightly tried to found natural philosophy on genesis, job, and sacred writings, seeking the dead among the living, making repression important because this mixture creates a fantastic philosophy and heretical religion, so we must be sober and give to faith only what is faith's.\n\nlxvi.\nso much for the harmful authorities of systems founded on common notions, few experiments, or superstition. it remains to discuss faulty subject matter in contemplation, especially natural philosophy. the understanding is infected by mechanics, where body alteration is through composition, imagining similar processes in universal nature, leading to the fiction of elements and their formation of natural bodies. when contemplating free nature, man finds species of animals, plants, minerals, leading to the belief in primary forms that nature intends to produce, with remaining variety from hindrances or transplanting. the former leads to primary qualities, the latter to occult properties and specific virtues, which divert from more solid pursuits. physicians better focus on secondary qualities and operations, but for the elementary qualities and specific virtues, they corrupt observations, either reducing them to first qualities or not following them to later qualities, halting prematurely. such powers should be sought in changes of all bodies, not just human medicines. it is worse to contemplate quiescent principles from which things are made rather than moving principles through which things are produced because the former leads to discourse and the latter to works. vulgar motion distinctions in natural philosophy are of little value, only indicating how far change goes. even causes of motion are introduced with negligence, distinguishing between natural and violent motion drawn entirely from vulgar notions, since all violent motion is natural, with an external agent simply setting nature to work. a true physical kind of motion would note bodies desiring mutual contact, resuming natural dimensions, or congregating towards kindred masses.\n\nit is also bad to spend time on first principles and highest generalities instead of things intermediate. men abstract nature to potential matter, and dissect it to atoms, which are of little use to mankind even if true.\n\nlxvii.\nthe understanding must be cautioned against the intemperance in giving or withholding assent in systems, which can establish and perpetuate idols. this excess is in those who decide quickly, making science dogmatic, and those who deny knowledge, leading to aimless inquiry, with the former subduing and the latter weakening the understanding. aristotle destroyed all other philosophies with hostile refutations and laid down laws, raising and disposing of new questions to leave nothing uncertain, a practice used by his successors. plato introduced acatalepsia in jest, disdaining older sophists, but the new academy made it a dogma, saying they allowed following probable things, but not maintaining truths. however, when the mind despairs of finding truth, interest weakens, leading to wandering disputations and discourses rather than severe inquiry. the human senses and understanding, though weak, should not be deprived of authority, but be given helps.\n\nlxviii.\nso much for the classes of idols and their followers; all must be renounced with a fixed resolve, and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed, since entering the kingdom of man through science is similar to entering heaven, where none enter except as a child.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Gemini"}, "uid": null}

{"id": 6129, "text": "according to two reports, phones aren't yet capable of functioning as comprehensive multimedia devices that can replace portable media players. jupiter stated that consumers don't want to sacrifice phone size and battery life for multimedia services, despite efforts to provide music download services on phones. gartner released a separate study indicating that real-time tv broadcasts on phones in europe are \"unlikely\" before 2007 because of technical and standards-related problems that need resolution. batteries must already support video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras, and games, among other things. more demands on battery life will be placed by music download services based on the success of computer-based download services. fifty percent of europeans said that phone size was the most important factor when choosing a phone, but more power demands tend to mean larger phones. a jupiter research mobile analyst, thomas husson, stated that mobile phone music services shouldn't be positioned to compete with the pc music experience because phones aren't ready. he said that mobile music services should be new and different, enabling operators to differentiate their brands and support third-generation network launches. other problems facing mobile music include limited phone storage compared to portable players, which can store up to 40gb of music. the mobile industry is eager to enter music downloading after the success of apple's itunes, napster, and other online music download services. as phones become smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to watch tv on the move. services like tivo to go allow people to transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones in the us. however, the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests that direct broadcasting will have to wait. several european operators, such as italy's tim and 3, currently offer tv-like services where clips are downloaded. according to the report, mobile tv must overcome several barriers before its widespread adoption. globally, various standards and methods of transmitting tv signals to phones are being developed. trials in berlin and helsinki are using terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to phones with extra receivers in europe. the norwegian broadcasting corporation has a service that allows people to watch tv programs on their phones 24 hours a day, using 3gp technology, which is one of the standards for mobile tv. the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe at the end of 2004. operators will work on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needed to set up the services must be addressed. handsets also need to work with the dvb-h standard. analysts say that tv services will also need to meet the expectations of the digital tv generation, which expects high-quality images at low prices. gartner stated that people are also likely to be deterred from watching tv on such small screens. digital video recorders, such as europe's sky+ box, and video-on-demand services mean people have more control over the tv they watch. broadcasting straight to mobiles may, as a result, be seen as removing that control. smartphones like the xda ii, nokia 6600, sonyericsson p900, and the orange e200, which offer web access, text and multimedia messaging, email, calendar, and gaming, are becoming increasingly common. according to a report by analysts instat/mdr, smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. by 2009, smartphones will make up 117 million of the 833 million handsets shipped globally, according to the report.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Gemini"}, "uid": null}

mrs. comstock wants elnora to stay home and work on the farm. the lack of money for tuition and books almost prevents her from continuing her education. her solace comes from her academic abilities, especially in math and science; the kindness of her neighbors, wesley and margaret sinton; a specimens box left to her by freckles in the swamp; and her successful efforts to collect and sell items and moths from the limberlost, which she stores in freckles's box secretly from her mother. elnora is intelligent, witty, and loves nature; she desires to be loved in return. she quickly makes friends at school. eventually, elnora earns her mother's love, but only after some difficult events. first, after doing well in high school, she wants to play the violin, like her father did. margaret sinton manages to get her the same violin robert comstock used to play, and elnora becomes skilled at it. she knows her mother hates the violin, but she doesn't know why, so she must keep her playing a secret. second, when elnora is in her final year of high school, wesley and margaret insist that katharine come with them to the school play. katharine is not interested in seeing \"what idiotic thing a pack of school children were doing.\" but katharine is curious about the high school; she enters it to mock it, then realizes she likes it; when she hears a violin, she enters the school play and sees elnora playing \"as only a peculiar chain of circumstances puts it in the power of a very few to play.\" seeing elnora playing her dead husband's violin to an appreciative audience, and realizing her world has irrevocably changed - \"the swamp had sent back the soul of her loved dead and put it into the body of the daughter she resented, and it was almost more than she could endure and live\" - katharine faints. third, a few days later, elnora thinks her mother understands that she needs to graduate so she can go to college or teach, both of which she would love to do. she tells katharine that she needs new dresses for commencement and trusts her to provide them. mrs. comstock, always rudely honest, gives her an old dress. elnora sees this as a major betrayal, showing her mother's lack of love and consideration for her. that night, elnora must find a good dress elsewhere. fourth, elnora has always hidden the fact that she earns money by selling moths from her mother. as she finishes her final year of high school and hopes to go to college, she realizes that there is one particular moth she must collect, which will pay her way to the future. in the novel's key conflict, elnora sees her mother destroy that moth. when she objects, mrs. comstock slaps her. elnora, who has always been patient, screams that she hates her mother and runs out. mrs. comstock, finally understanding how important elnora is to her stable home life, sets out that night to replace the moth. she makes things worse, a fact which elnora keeps from her, but when the sintons discover that mrs. comstock hit elnora, margaret decides to intervene. she tells katharine that she has been mourning for a husband who was unfaithful and planning to cheat on her. with this news, katharine understands how she has neglected her loving, talented daughter. elnora graduates and is now 19 years old. a young man, philip ammon, arrives in town. his uncle, a doctor, has sent philip to onabasha to recover from typhoid fever. he stays with elnora and her mother for the summer and helps elnora collect moths. the two slowly fall in love; however, he is already engaged to another young woman, edith carr, who is wealthy, spoiled, and self-centered. elnora, to pretend that she is not beginning to fall for philip, helps him write letters to edith carr and encourages his marriage to his childhood friend in every way. when philip, after daily, prolonged conversation and fieldwork, discovers his romantic interest in elnora is growing, mrs. comstock is the first to notice, but he assures her, \"i admire her as i admire any perfect creation.\" mrs. comstock replies, \"and nothing in all this world spoils the average girl so quickly and so surely.\" philip ammon is forced to return to chicago when his father becomes ill, and he asks elnora for a farewell kiss; she refuses him and returns to her mother, broken-hearted. philip and edith have an argument at what was supposed to be their engagement party. edith insults him terribly and calls their engagement off (not for the first time). she has heard philip talk about a wonderful young lady he met in the limberlost. philip leaves home and proposes to elnora. on the very afternoon that he gives elnora an engagement ring, edith drives up, with some friends, to the comstocks' home, in an unasked-for visit. when edith demands to speak to elnora privately and swears that elnora will never take philip from her, elnora is cool and polite. when edith's group leaves, elnora secretly leaves, giving edith the chance to prove that philip would marry no one else. philip becomes ill with worry about elnora, and edith's friend hart persuades her to admit that she is wrong and that philip will marry no one except elnora. in the conclusion, it is suggested that edith will marry hart, just as philip will marry elnora.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Gemini"}, "uid": null}

{"id": 6309, "text": "as the hyperion pilgrims journeyed to the time tombs, they told stories which revealed their reasons for participating in the shrike cult pilgrimage. at the beginning of the narrative, the pilgrims waited while a sandstorm took place in the valley. father hoyt, seeking death to escape his cruciform's pain, went to the jade tomb and tried to end his life, but the shrike killed him. brawne lamia, noticing hoyt's disappearance, found him at the tomb and encountered the shrike, firing at it with no effect before it vanished. kassad quietly watched, hoping to draw moneta and the shrike out to confront them. the remaining pilgrims asked the consul to bring his ship to the valley for medical supplies for rachel weintraub, who was dying. the consul reluctantly agreed, but the ship was interdicted by gladstone and hyperion authorities. following this, lamia and silenus were sent to keep chronos and the poets' city for food. silenus went to the poets' city to complete his \"hyperion cantos\", but was surprised by the shrike and impaled on the tree of thorns. lamia got the needed supplies at keep chronos and returned to the valley, but the shrike attacked her, and she lost consciousness. she awoke at the edge of the technocore in a computerized reality, accompanied by the john keats persona from her implant. ummon, an ai, revealed several technocore motivations before killing the persona, and lamia lost consciousness again. father paul dur\u00e9 was resurrected from hoyt's body and briefed by the consul on the journey. he chose to wait with sol weintraub and lamia while the consul used his hawking mat to reach keats and try to use his connections to free his ship. the consul crashed miles from keats and was captured by thieves, escaping due to theo lane, who returned with him to the capital. at the tombs, true voice of the tree het masteen reappeared and revealed shrike cult and templar brotherhood collusion before dying. dur\u00e9 left sol, supposedly for a \"walk\", and vanished. moments before rachel's birth and the time tombs \"opening\", sol took baby rachel to the sphinx tomb, where the shrike took her inside. severn's character, the second john keats \"cybrid,\" appeared at a government house event on tau ceti center, where he claimed to be an artist providing an artistic view of the war for hyperion, which the ousters were attacking. at the event, hegemony officials watched a force fleet leave for hyperion, after which severn accepted an invitation to dinner from lady diana philomel. after the dinner, severn was seized by philomel, her husband, and associates, who tried to get classified information from him, but they were interrupted by hegemony security who arrested his captors. severn then watched hegemony cabinet and gladstone's inner circle meetings, updating gladstone on the pilgrims while pretending to be an artist. suddenly, between meetings, gladstone learned that the ousters had counterattacked the worldweb, an unexpected move. force strategic reserves were committed to hyperion, so the first worlds threatened by the ouster invasion seemed doomed. severn toured several of the worlds, narrowly escaping a mob that recognized him as one of gladstone's associates. as shrike cult uprisings devastated hegemony planets, keats traveled to pacem and met father dur\u00e9, who had disappeared from hyperion after entering the planet's underground labyrinth and had been escorted by the shrike to pacem, where he spoke with monsignor edouard about his past experiences. dur\u00e9, intrigued by the collusion between the templar brotherhood and the shrike cult, went to god's grove, which was soon to be within range of the ouster invasion armada. severn, accompanied by leigh hunt, farcast to tau ceti center but arrived on an analog of 19th century earth, specifically rome, where the historical keats died. like the original keats, severn contracted tuberculosis and died physically, but his persona retreated into the technocore's computerized realities. the consul met with the ouster swarm leaders attacking hyperion, which was about to fall. he was tried for the murder of ouster agents he had killed previously, but he was sentenced only to live during the coming turbulent times. the consul then learned that there was no ouster offensive against the worldweb, and he concluded that the technocore was the only power capable of such an attack. the ousters offered the hegemony support in their struggle against the technocore, but only in retaliation for the hegemony's fall, which they claimed was inevitable since the ousters refused to use farcasters. gladstone, who had decided to use a technocore device against the ousters while hegemony citizens evacuated and retreated into the labyrinths, received this information and discovered that force autopsies of ouster bodies revealed that the \"ousters\" were actually technocore \"cybrids.\" gladstone retired briefly and was approached by severn in a dream. having met with ummon, his creator, severn had learned that the technocore resided within the farcaster system, fearing alien intelligences (lions and tigers and bears) to be found in the void which binds. gladstone ordered the destruction of the farcaster network, knowing that it would cause death and chaos, but also stop technocore activity. she did so and resigned as chief executive. back on hyperion, brawne lamia, having awakened from her coma, entered the shrike palace to find silenus and the shrike's other victims connected via a long cable. she freed silenus as the shrike appeared to attack her. she froze the shrike, and it fell over a precipice and shattered. meanwhile, sol's daughter rachel appeared outside the time tombs as a young woman, carrying her younger self (now aging normally again). giving her younger form to sol, she explained that she was moneta and was now traveling back in time with the shrike under orders from humanity's future. she disappeared, and sol decided to go forward in time to rachel's future using the portal. force elements discovered that the technocore invasion had suddenly stopped, and that the invasion armada lacked any personnel. throughout the former worldweb, chaos broke out, with shocked hegemony citizens becoming violent. on tau ceti center, government house was besieged by a furious assembly of citizens. gladstone allowed herself to be killed by the demonstrators, remaining on the planet even after her de jure successor, senator gabriel kolchev, fled. the story concluded several months later; the worst of the chaos had subsided, and hyperion was flourishing again, with former hegemony citizens and ousters co-existing. new glyphs gave some insight to the time tombs, and the portal to the future rarely admitted a person. the novel ended with the consul returning to the former web worlds in his starship to discover what happened, with severn's ai stored in his ship.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Gemini"}, "uid": null}

{"id": 6375, "text": "ilan papp\u00e9 asserts that around 800,000 palestinians were forcibly displaced in 1948, a figure representing over half the palestinian population at the time, and that 531 villages were destroyed, along with 11 urban palestinian neighborhoods. palestinians call this event the nakba, or the catastrophe. papp\u00e9 argues that the nakba was a deliberately planned act of ethnic cleansing by zionist israelis. he insists that this view is unambiguous, citing zionist writings, military and political documents, and david ben-gurion's diaries. he also aims to understand why the denial of the nakba has been so successful. this viewpoint is contrary to the mainstream israeli narrative, which claims the relocation was voluntary. ilan papp\u00e9 believes acknowledging the past is crucial for a better future. he claims that the idea of ethnic cleansing appeared early in zionist writings, citing leo motzkin's statement in 1917 about jewish settlement and arab resettlement, and david ben-gurion's 1938 support for compulsory transfer. he also indicates that this was implemented in 1948 by david ben-gurion, yigael yadin, moshe dayan, yigal allon, yitzhak sadeh, moshe kalman, moshe camel, yitzak rabin, shimon avidan, rehavam zeevi, yitzhak pundak, and others. ben-gurion's advisors, referred to as the 'consultancy group', were the ideological drivers, while officers leading attacks by the haganah, irgun, stern gang, and israeli defense force were the implementers. the \"ethnic cleansing strategy\" is detailed in plan dalet, an israeli military/government document, which papp\u00e9 says contained clear directives for the operation. these directives included 'bombarding villages\u2026setting fire to homes, properties and goods, expulsion, demolition and planting mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled inhabitants from returning.' papp\u00e9 discusses the definition of ethnic cleansing based on ethics, international law, and agreements, referring to sources such as the united nations commission on human rights, the united states department of state, and the international criminal court. he also mentions the u.s.'s brief support for palestinian return through united nations general assembly resolution 194. according to papp\u00e9, the expelled are removed from official history and collective memory. he concludes that the erasure of this alleged ethnic cleansing from conventional israeli history has been successful. papp\u00e9 asserts that the creation of an exclusively jewish israeli state was a key element of zionism. he also states that, prior to the british mandate, palestine had been under muslim control for 1300 years. zionism grew in the 1880s, particularly through theodore herzl's writings, and gained momentum by the time britain controlled palestine after world war i. after the balfour declaration on october 31, 1917, yosef weitz began a detailed demographic study of palestinian villages called the village files, which was later used for strategic information in the ethnic cleansing of palestine. he discusses the british military operations that suppressed palestinian uprisings in 1929 and 1937, with the 1937 uprising significantly weakening the palestinians' ability to fight for their homeland. the haganah and the irgun also received key training from britain. ben-gurion stated, 'the arabs will have to go.' ben-gurion's state-building strategy included plans a, b, c, and d, which involved specific military actions intended to deter palestinian attacks on jewish settlements and retaliate against assaults on jewish properties. plan c outlined punitive measures such as killing palestinian leaders, inciters, financial supporters, officers, and officials, as well as damaging palestinian transportation, livelihoods, and attacking nearby villages and meeting places. plan dalet called for the total expulsion of palestinians from their homeland. in 1947, papp\u00e9 recalls, the united nations special committee on palestine proposed the creation of two states and the united nations general assembly passed resolution 181. he also recalls that this was immediately rejected by the palestinians. david ben-gurion's advisors, that papp\u00e9 calls the consultancy, began its planning to deal with the palestinian resistance. plan d (plan dalet) was adopted on march 10, 1948. it called for, amongst many things, the initial uprooting of 250,000 palestinians. the jordanian promise to not join any all-arab military operations against the jewish state followed key negotiations between israel and jordan. the british departed palestine on 15 may 1948. haganah had 50,000 trained troops. the implementation of plan dalet continued in earnest. the deir yassin massacre occurred. in it, 93 palestinians were killed. soon after, four more villages were taken. they were qalunya, saris, beit surik, and biddu. the united states offered a scheme to stop the bloodshed by first establishing a three-month cease-fire and then developing a trusteeship plan in five years. both ideas were rejected by the israelis. ben-gurion had stated \"only a state with at least 80% jews is a viable and stable state\" and that palestinians 'can either be mass arrested or expelled; it is better to expel them.' papp\u00e9 states that many palestinian villages such as dayr ayyub, beit affa, and khisas had virtually no defense mechanism of any kind. the attack on balad al-shaykh occurred leaving 60 palestinians dead. the hawassa neighborhood in haifa was evacuated. the sarraya house in jaffa was bombed leaving 26 dead and the samiramis hotel in qatamon was bombed leaving many others dead. papp\u00e9 refers to yosef weitz again, a member of the consultancy. weitz had stated, 'the only solution is to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries. not a single village or a single tribe must be left off.' papp\u00e9 describes various cities, and villages, and the operations to cleanse them. operation naschon was the first operation of plan dalet. it specifically called for the destruction of palestinian villages in april 1948. it was the first time that the various israeli militias would operate together as a unit and become the israeli defense force. papp\u00e9 states 'the arab governments did little beyond airing their inflammatory war rhetoric in all directions so as to hide their inaction and unwillingness to intervene on behalf of the palestinians.' the united nations plan had allocated haifa, the only port of the country, to be granted jewish control. mordechai maklef as the operation officer of the carmeli brigade, issued orders to 'kill any arab you encounter; torch all inflammable objects and force doors open with explosives'. crowds of defenseless palestinians ran down the streets of haifa to the port to escape on any boat they could find. 'many [boats] turned over and sank with all their passengers'. the next cities to fall were acre, nazareth and safad. papp\u00e9 states that the arab liberation army was never a match against the well organized israeli forces. according to papp\u00e9, there was never serious arab liberation army strength, so 'the falsity of the myth of a jewish david facing an arab goliath' was very clear. as jerusalem was cleansed, 'british inaction was the rule.' in april 1948 the cleansing of jerusalem began. 'all in all, eight palestinian and thirty nine villages were ethnically cleansed in the greater jerusalem area.' after the battle was won by the israeli haganah, 50,000 palestinians were forced to leave jaffa. by 15 may 1948 200 palestinian villages were occupied and their people expelled. this chapter discuses the dual nature of the 1948 conflict particularly during may 1948. on one hand there was the arab israeli war and on the other hand there was the ethnic cleansing. in a letter that david ben-gurion sent to the commanders of the haganah brigades he stated, 'the cleansing of palestine remained the prime objective of plan dalet.' papp\u00e9 states that the arab war efforts were 'ineffective', and 'pathetic'. the most intensive arab efforts occurred in the first three weeks of the war. ethnic cleansing was conducted in at least 64 villages by the israeli alexandria brigade according to papp\u00e9 they were also part of the massacre at tantura, per ilan papp\u00e9, on may 2, 1948. he quotes from various witnesses that as many as 230 were massacred there. various other brigades such as the golani brigade, carmeli brigade, kiryati brigade, harel brigade, bulgarian brigade, yiftach brigade, and givati brigade also conducted cleansing operations. papp\u00e9, in this chapter, discusses june through september 1948. the ethnic cleansing continued despite the passage of the universal declaration of human rights through the united nations general assembly resolution 217a(iii) david ben-gurion's diary june 5, 1948 states, 'the cleansing operation continues.' eliezer kaplan, the minister of finance authorized the confiscation of all palestinian properties already taken. papp\u00e9 states that numerous palestinian villages had been peacefully occupied by muslim, druze, and christians for centuries. on july 18, 1948 another truce was organized by the u.n. mediator count folke bernadotte. papp\u00e9 states, 'in less than two weeks, hundreds of thousands of palestinians had been expelled from their villages, towns, and cities.' papp\u00e9 begins this chapter with quotes from the badil resource center. 'in 1948, 85% of the palestinians living in the areas that became the state of israel became refugees.' 'it is estimated that there were more than 7 million palestinian displaced persons at the beginning of 2003.' he talks about operation hiram, war crimes during the operation, mopping up operations, israel's anti-reparation policy, final cleansing of the south and the east, and the massacre in dawaymeh. papp\u00e9 states 'i have no illusion that it will take more than this book to reverse a reality that demonizes a people who have been colonized, expelled, and occupied, and glorifies the very people who colonized, expelled and occupied them.' papp\u00e9 starts this chapter with another set of quotes about ethnic cleansing, including, 'since 1967, israel has detained 670,000 palestinians.' sections of this chapter are entitled inhuman imprisonment, abuses under occupation, ghettoizing the palestinians of haifa, rape, dividing the spoils, desecration of holy sites, entrenching the occupation, and the land robbery: 1950\u20132000. this chapter, like others, starts with provocative quotes. 'over 700,000 olive and orange trees have been destroyed by the israelis. this is an act of sheer vandalism from a state that claims to practice conservation of the environment.' the sections of this chapter include; the reinvention of palestine, virtual colonialism and the j.n.f., the j.n.f. parks in israel, the forest of birya, the ramat menahse park, and greening of jerusalem. papp\u00e9 states that 'the israeli land authority, the army, the government and the jewish national fund' have all been 'involved in establishing new jewish settlements on the lands of the destroyed palestinian villages.' he goes on to state, 'the true mission of the j.n.f., in other words, has been to conceal these visible remnants of palestine not only by the trees it has planted over them, but also by the narratives it has created to deny their existence.' as an example, papp\u00e9 refers to the forest of birya, which is the largest man made forest in israel. it conceals the land of six palestinian villages; dishon, alma,israel, qaddita, amqa, ayn al-zaytun, and biryya. also the ramat menashe park covers the ruins of lajjun, mansi, kafrayan, al-butaymat, hubeza, daliyat al-rawha, sabbarin, burayka, al-sindiyana, and umm al-zinat. the jerusalem forest is another example. here papp\u00e9 states that the creation of the united nations relief and work agency was not committed to the return of the refugees as resolution 194 was. there were one million palestinian refugees and u.n.r.w.a. was created to meet their daily needs as refugees. he states that international peace brokers consistently sidelined the palestinian cause and there 'was the categorical refusal of the israelis to acknowledge the nakba and their absolute unwillingness to be held accountable, legally, and morally, for the ethnic cleansing they committed in 1948.' for the following two decades there was a lull in international interest. then, 'the june war (1967) ended with total israeli control over all of ex-mandatory palestine.' as a response, for four decades, yassar arafat conducted a campaign to get the world to recognize that an ethnic cleansing had occurred in 1948. and according to papp\u00e9, this task for the palestinians continues to today. papp\u00e9 mentions that the knesset had even gone to the extent of passing a law that prohibited israeli negotiators from discussing the right of return. he also speculates that if israelis were to acknowledge the nakba that it would be akin to recognizing 'that they have become the mirror image of their own worst nightmare.' this chapter is about various measures israel has taken to protect itself. as an example, papp\u00e9 starts this chapter by describing a law the knesset passed on 31 july 2003. this law states that any palestinian who marries an israeli will not be granted israeli citizenship, permanent residency, or temporary residency. he also discusses the advent of the israeli west bank barrier. he states, 'none of this is new.' because theodore herzl wrote in 1895, 'we shall endeavor to expel the poor population across the border unnoticed, procuring employment for it in the transit countries, but denying it any employment in our own country.' in 2003 benyamin netanyahu said, 'if the arabs in israel form 40% of the population, this is the end of the jewish state. but 20% is also a problem. if the relationship with these 20% becomes problematic, the state is entitled to employ extreme measures.' here, papp\u00e9 states that the faculty club of tel aviv university is called the green house. it is built upon the remains of the palestinian village, shaykh muwannis. it is the epitome of the denial of ethnic cleansing according to papp\u00e9 because there is no mention of its true history. papp\u00e9 goes on to say, furthermore, that the university does not have a record of looking into the zionist history of ethnic cleansing whatsoever in any of its disciplines. he concludes by saying 'we end this book as we began: with the bewilderment that this crime was so utterly forgotten and erased from our minds and memories. but we now know the price: the ideology that enabled the depopulation of half of palestine's native people in 1948 is still alive and continues to drive inexorable, sometimes indiscernible, cleansing of those palestinians who live there today.'\naccording to ilan papp\u00e9, around 800,000 palestinians were made to leave their homes in 1948, representing over half of the palestinian population at the time. also, 531 villages and 11 palestinian urban neighborhoods were destroyed. palestinians refer to this event as the nakba, or the catastrophe. papp\u00e9's argument is that the nakba was a calculated act of ethnic cleansing by zionist israelis. he insists this is certain, using zionist writings, military and political documents, and david ben-gurion's diaries as evidence. he also wants to understand why the denial of the nakba has lasted so long. his perspective differs from the mainstream israeli view, which claims the relocation was voluntary. ilan papp\u00e9 believes that understanding the past is necessary for a better future. the idea of ethnic cleansing, he states, appeared in early zionist writings. he cites leo motzkin's 1917 statement about jewish settlement and arab resettlement, and david ben-gurion's 1938 support for compulsory transfer. he also states that david ben-gurion, yigael yadin, moshe dayan, yigal allon, yitzhak sadeh, moshe kalman, moshe camel, yitzak rabin, shimon avidan, rehavam zeevi, yitzhak pundak, and others implemented the plans in 1948. he identifies ben-gurion's advisors, the 'consultancy group,' as the ideological drivers, and officers from the haganah, irgun, stern gang, and israeli defense force as the implementers. the \"ethnic cleansing strategy\" is detailed in plan dalet, which, according to papp\u00e9, contained explicit directives for the operation including 'bombarding villages\u2026setting fire to homes, properties and goods, expulsion, demolition and planting mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled inhabitants from returning.' papp\u00e9 explores the definition of ethnic cleansing in relation to ethics, international law, and agreements, referencing the united nations commission on human rights, the united states department of state, and the international criminal court. he also mentions the u.s.'s brief support for palestinian return through united nations general assembly resolution 194. papp\u00e9 states that the expelled are removed from official history and collective memory. he concludes that the erasure of this alleged ethnic cleansing from conventional israeli history has been successful. papp\u00e9 says that an exclusively

between israel and jordan. the british departed palestine on 15 may 1948. haganah had 50,000 trained troops. the implementation of plan dalet continued in earnest. the deir yassin massacre occurred. in it, 93 palestinians were killed. soon after, four more villages were taken. they were qalunya, saris, beit surik, and biddu. the united states offered a scheme to stop the bloodshed by first establishing a three-month cease-fire and then developing a trusteeship plan in five years. both ideas were rejected by the israelis. ben-gurion had stated \"only a state with at least 80% jews is a viable and stable state\" and that palestinians 'can either be mass arrested or expelled; it is better to expel them.' papp\u00e9 states that many palestinian villages such as dayr ayyub, beit affa, and khisas had virtually no defense mechanism of any kind. the attack on balad al-shaykh occurred leaving 60 palestinians dead. the hawassa neighborhood in haifa was evacuated. the sarraya house in jaffa was bombed leaving 26 dead and the samiramis hotel in qatamon was bombed leaving many others dead. papp\u00e9 refers to yosef weitz again, a member of the consultancy. weitz had stated, 'the only solution is to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries. not a single village or a single tribe must be left off.' papp\u00e9 describes various cities, and villages, and the operations to cleanse them. operation naschon was the first operation of plan dalet. it specifically called for the destruction of palestinian villages in april 1948. it was the first time that the various israeli militias would operate together as a unit and become the israeli defense force. papp\u00e9 states 'the arab governments did little beyond airing their inflammatory war rhetoric in all directions so as to hide their inaction and unwillingness to intervene on behalf of the palestinians.' the united nations plan had allocated haifa, the only port of the country, to be granted jewish control. mordechai maklef as the operation officer of the carmeli brigade, issued orders to 'kill any arab you encounter; torch all inflammable objects and force doors open with explosives'. crowds of defenseless palestinians ran down the streets of haifa to the port to escape on any boat they could find. 'many [boats] turned over and sank with all their passengers'. the next cities to fall were acre, nazareth and safad. papp\u00e9 states that the arab liberation army was never a match against the well organized israeli forces. according to papp\u00e9, there was never serious arab liberation army strength, so 'the falsity of the myth of a jewish david facing an arab goliath' was very clear. as jerusalem was cleansed, 'british inaction was the rule.' in april 1948 the cleansing of jerusalem began. 'all in all, eight palestinian and thirty nine villages were ethnically cleansed in the greater jerusalem area.' after the battle was won by the israeli haganah, 50,000 palestinians were forced to leave jaffa. by 15 may 1948 200 palestinian villages were occupied and their people expelled. this chapter discuses the dual nature of the 1948 conflict particularly during may 1948. on one hand there was the arab israeli war and on the other hand there was the ethnic cleansing. in a letter that david ben-gurion sent to the commanders of the haganah brigades he stated, 'the cleansing of palestine remained the prime objective of plan dalet.' papp\u00e9 states that the arab war efforts were 'ineffective', and 'pathetic'. the most intensive arab efforts occurred in the first three weeks of the war. ethnic cleansing was conducted in at least 64 villages by the israeli alexandria brigade according to papp\u00e9 they were also part of the massacre at tantura, per ilan papp\u00e9, on may 2, 1948. he quotes from various witnesses that as many as 230 were massacred there. various other brigades such as the golani brigade, carmeli brigade, kiryati brigade, harel brigade, bulgarian brigade, yiftach brigade, and givati brigade also conducted cleansing operations. papp\u00e9, in this chapter, discusses june through september 1948. the ethnic cleansing continued despite the passage of the universal declaration of human rights through the united nations general assembly resolution 217a(iii) david ben-gurion's diary june 5, 1948 states, 'the cleansing operation continues.' eliezer kaplan, the minister of finance authorized the confiscation of all palestinian properties already taken. papp\u00e9 states that numerous palestinian villages had been peacefully occupied by muslim, druze, and christians for centuries. on july 18, 1948 another truce was organized by the u.n. mediator count folke bernadotte. papp\u00e9 states, 'in less than two weeks, hundreds of thousands of palestinians had been expelled from their villages, towns, and cities.' papp\u00e9 begins this chapter with quotes from the badil resource center. 'in 1948, 85% of the palestinians living in the areas that became the state of israel became refugees.' 'it is estimated that there were more than 7 million palestinian displaced persons at the beginning of 2003.' he talks about operation hiram, war crimes during the operation, mopping up operations, israel's anti-reparation policy, final cleansing of the south and the east, and the massacre in dawaymeh. papp\u00e9 states 'i have no illusion that it will take more than this book to reverse a reality that demonizes a people who have been colonized, expelled, and occupied, and glorifies the very people who colonized, expelled and occupied them.' papp\u00e9 starts this chapter with another set of quotes about ethnic cleansing, including, 'since 1967, israel has detained 670,000 palestinians.' sections of this chapter are entitled inhuman imprisonment, abuses under occupation, ghettoizing the palestinians of haifa, rape, dividing the spoils, desecration of holy sites, entrenching the occupation, and the land robbery: 1950\u20132000. this chapter, like others, starts with provocative quotes. 'over 700,000 olive and orange trees have been destroyed by the israelis. this is an act of sheer vandalism from a state that claims to practice conservation of the environment.' the sections of this chapter include; the reinvention of palestine, virtual colonialism and the j.n.f., the j.n.f. parks in israel, the forest of birya, the ramat menahse park, and greening of jerusalem. papp\u00e9 states that 'the israeli land authority, the army, the government and the jewish national fund' have all been 'involved in establishing new jewish settlements on the lands of the destroyed palestinian villages.' he goes on to state, 'the true mission of the j.n.f., in other words, has been to conceal these visible remnants of palestine not only by the trees it has planted over them, but also by the narratives it has created to deny their existence.' as an example, papp\u00e9 refers to the forest of birya, which is the largest man made forest in israel. it conceals the land of six palestinian villages; dishon, alma,israel, qaddita, amqa, ayn al-zaytun, and biryya. also the ramat menashe park covers the ruins of lajjun, mansi, kafrayan, al-butaymat, hubeza, daliyat al-rawha, sabbarin, burayka, al-sindiyana, and umm al-zinat. the jerusalem forest is another example. here papp\u00e9 states that the creation of the united nations relief and work agency was not committed to the return of the refugees as resolution 194 was. there were one million palestinian refugees and u.n.r.w.a. was created to meet their daily needs as refugees. he states that international peace brokers consistently sidelined the palestinian cause and there 'was the categorical refusal of the israelis to acknowledge the nakba and their absolute unwillingness to be held accountable, legally, and morally, for the ethnic cleansing they committed in 1948.' for the following two decades there was a lull in international interest. then, 'the june war (1967) ended with total israeli control over all of ex-mandatory palestine.' as a response, for four decades, yassar arafat conducted a campaign to get the world to recognize that an ethnic cleansing had occurred in 1948. and according to papp\u00e9, this task for the palestinians continues to today. papp\u00e9 mentions that the knesset had even gone to the extent of passing a law that prohibited israeli negotiators from discussing the right of return. he also speculates that if israelis were to acknowledge the nakba that it would be akin to recognizing 'that they have become the mirror image of their own worst nightmare.' this chapter is about various measures israel has taken to protect itself. as an example, papp\u00e9 starts this chapter by describing a law the knesset passed on 31 july 2003. this law states that any palestinian who marries an israeli will not be granted israeli citizenship, permanent residency, or temporary residency. he also discusses the advent of the israeli west bank barrier. he states, 'none of this is new.' because theodore herzl wrote in 1895, 'we shall endeavor to expel the poor population across the border unnoticed, procuring employment for it in the transit countries, but denying it any employment in our own country.' in 2003 benyamin netanyahu said, 'if the arabs in israel form 40% of the population, this is the end of the jewish state. but 20% is also a problem. if the relationship with these 20% becomes problematic, the state is entitled to employ extreme measures.' here, papp\u00e9 states that the faculty club of tel aviv university is called the green house. it is built upon the remains of the palestinian village, shaykh muwannis. it is the epitome of the denial of ethnic cleansing according to papp\u00e9 because there is no mention of its true history. papp\u00e9 goes on to say, furthermore, that the university does not have a record of looking into the zionist history of ethnic cleansing whatsoever in any of its disciplines. he concludes by saying 'we end this book as we began: with the bewilderment that this crime was so utterly forgotten and erased from our minds and memories. but we now know the price: the ideology that enabled the depopulation of half of palestine's native people in 1948 is still alive and continues to drive inexorable, sometimes indiscernible, cleansing of those palestinians who live there today.'\nilan papp\u00e9 contends that nearly 800,000 palestinians were forcefully removed from their homes in 1948, which was more than half the entire population. also, 531 villages were destroyed and 11 palestinian urban neighborhoods were emptied. palestinians refer to this event as the nakba, meaning catastrophe. papp\u00e9's thesis is that the nakba was a planned and deliberately executed ethnic cleansing by zionist israelis. he emphasizes that this is an undeniable fact and includes references to zionist quotes and writings, military and political archives, and the diaries of david ben-gurion. he also intends to explore how the denial of the nakba has been so effective. his views are in direct opposition to mainstream israeli perspectives of the relocation, which claim it was 'voluntary'. in his preface, ilan papp\u00e9 states that addressing the past is the only way to improve the future. papp\u00e9 asserts that the idea of ethnic cleansing was expressed in early zionist writings. as an example, in 1917, leo motzkin said, 'the colonization of palestine has to go in two directions, jewish settlement\u2026and the resettlement of the arabs.' in 1938, david ben-gurion stated, 'i am for compulsory transfer; i do not see anything immoral in it.' then in 1948, according to ilan papp\u00e9, the ethnic cleansing was implemented by david ben-gurion, yigael yadin, moshe dayan, yigal allon, yitzhak sadeh, moshe kalman, moshe camel, yitzak rabin, shimon avidan, rehavam zeevi, yitzhak pundak, and others. the ideological forces behind the campaign were ben-gurion's advisors, who papp\u00e9 calls the 'consultancy group'. the officers who led attacks executed by the haganah, the irgun, the stern gang, and the israeli defense force were the implementers. the \"ethnic cleansing strategy\" is described in plan dalet, an israeli military/government document. according to papp\u00e9, plan dalet outlines the clear directives of the operation in writing, including 'bombarding villages\u2026setting fire to homes, properties and goods, expulsion, demolition and planting mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled inhabitants from returning.' this chapter focuses on the definition of ethnic cleansing in terms of ethics and international law and international agreements. papp\u00e9 refers to the united nations commission on human rights, the united states department of state, and the international criminal court for sources of discussion. he also discusses the u.s.'s short-lived support for the palestinians by endorsing united nations general assembly resolution 194, which calls for the return of the displaced palestinian refugees. papp\u00e9 states that 'later on, the expelled are then erased from the country's official and popular history and excised from its collective memory.' he concludes that this alleged ethnic cleansing has been successfully erased from conventional israeli history. papp\u00e9 states in this chapter that a key ingredient in the zionist creation of an israeli state was such that it would be created exclusively for jews. prior to the british mandate, palestine had been under muslim control for 1300 years. zionism emerged in the 1880s, largely through the writings of theodore herzl. the zionist movement had been growing steadily by the time that britain took control of palestine after world war i. on october 31, 1917, the balfour declaration occurred. 'lord balfour gave the zionist movement his promise\u2026to establish a national home for the jews in palestine.' in the 1920s, palestinians made up 80\u201390 percent of the population of palestine. as a result of the balfour declaration, yosef weitz began a detailed demographic study of the palestinian villages called the village files. it was later used for key strategic information needed to implement the ethnic cleansing of palestine. this chapter also includes a history of the impact of british military operations in suppressing the palestinian uprisings in 1929 and 1937. the uprising in 1937 was significant in that the british thoroughly defeated the palestinians, strategically impacting their ability to fight for their rights to their homeland. britain provided key training for the haganah and the irgun. david ben-gurion stated, 'the arabs will have to go.' ben-gurion's strategy for the creation of the israeli state included offensive military steps, described in plans a, b, c, and d. 'the purpose of such actions would be to deter the palestinian population from attacking jewish settlements, and to retaliate for assaults on jewish houses, roads, and traffic. plan c spelled out clearly what punitive actions would entail, such as * killing the palestinian leadership. * killing palestinian inciters and their financial supporters. * killing palestinians who acted against jews. * killing senior palestinian officers and officials. * damaging palestinian transportation. * damaging the sources of palestinian livelihoods: water wells, mills etc. attacking nearby palestinian villages likely to assist in future attacks. * attacking palestinian clubs, coffeehouses, meeting places, etc.' plan dalet (plan d) called for the systematic and total expulsion of palestinians from their homeland. here papp\u00e9 recalls that in 1947 the united nations special committee on palestine called for the creation of two states and the united nations general assembly passed resolution 181 stating so. the palestinians immediately rejected this. then david ben-gurion's group of close advisors, that papp\u00e9 calls the consultancy, began its planning to deal with the palestinian resistance. plan d (plan dalet) was adopted on march 10, 1948. it called for, amongst many things, the initial uprooting of 250,000 palestinians. this initial uprooting represented the beginning of the actual execution of plan dalet. key negotiations between israel and jordan had led to the jordanian promise to not join any all-arab military operations against the jewish state. the agreement 'neutralized the strongest army in the arab world.' the british departed palestine on 15 may 1948. haganah had 50,000 trained troops. the implementation of plan dalet continued in earnest. the deir yassin massacre occurred. in it, 93 palestinians were killed. soon after, four more villages were taken. they were qalunya, saris, beit surik, and biddu. the united states offered a scheme to stop the bloodshed by first establishing a three-month cease-fire and then developing a trusteeship plan in five years. both ideas were rejected by the israelis. ben-gurion had stated \"only a state with at least 80% jews is a viable and stable state\" and that palestinians 'can either be mass arrested or expelled; it is better to expel them.' papp\u00e9 states that many palestinian villages such as dayr ayyub, beit affa, and khisas had virtually no defense mechanism of any kind. the attack on balad al-shaykh occurred leaving 60 palestinians dead. the hawassa neighborhood in haifa was evacuated. the sarraya house in jaffa was bombed leaving 26 dead and the samiramis hotel in qatamon was bombed leaving many others dead. papp\u00e9 refers to yosef weitz again, a member of the consultancy. weitz had stated, 'the only solution is to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries. not a single village or a single tribe must be left off.' in this chapter, papp\u00e9 describes various cities, and villages, and the operations to cleanse them. operation naschon was the first operation of plan dalet. it specifically called for the destruction of palestinian villages in april 1948. it was the first time that the various israeli militias would operate together as a unit and become the israeli defense force. papp\u00e9 states 'the arab governments did little beyond airing their inflammatory war rhetoric in all directions so as to hide their inaction and unwillingness to intervene on behalf of the palestinians.' the united nations plan had allocated haifa, the only port of the country, to be granted jewish control. mordechai maklef as the operation officer of the carmeli brigade, issued orders to 'kill any arab you encounter; torch all inflammable objects and force doors open with explosives'. crowds of defenseless palestinians ran down the streets of haifa to the port to escape on any boat they could find.

although it is said that he fell from a horse, suspicion falls on queen desire, king shrewd's second wife and regal's mother, who is believed to have orchestrated his assassination. as fitz grows up at buckkeep, the coastal regions of the six duchies are under attack by outislanders known as the red-ship raiders. the raiders pillage villages and towns, killing and abducting people while taking very little of value, making their attacks seem without clear motivation. the hostages are later returned in an animalistic condition, with little recollection of their past lives. when fitz encounters these returned hostages, he discovers that he cannot sense them with his wit at all. this dehumanization process is named after forge, the first village to suffer such a raid. subsequently, these forged ones become robbers and thieves, further burdening the six duchies. fitz joins a class of students who are taught the skill, a form of magic that allows users to share thoughts and strength. the instructor, galen, harbors animosity towards fitz, while curiously revering his father (later in the book, it is revealed that chivalry imprinted a false loyalty on him, using the skill, in a fit of rage). during the classes, galen treats fitz with disrespect, frequently referring to him as \"bastard.\" he attempts to kill fitz, and, failing that, tries to sabotage his skill training. during the final test of galen's skill classes, galen sends fitz to forge, ostensibly to determine if he can use the skill to get back. the area is overrun with forged ones, and fitz is attacked, but he manages to return safely. during his absence, a stable hand, in league with galen, attempts to assassinate burrich. in the midst of this, smithy, the dog lady patience gave fitz, with whom fitz is wit-bonded, is killed. towards the end of the book fitz is asked to go to the neighboring mountain kingdom with the objective of assassinating its prince, rurisk. however, this mission is compromised when regal reveals fitz's secret mission to rurisk's sister, kettricken, while drunk, rendering him useless. he becomes embroiled in a scheme to seize the throne for prince regal with the help of galen, who attempts to assassinate verity using the skill. prince rurisk is poisoned and killed, leaving kettricken, who is betrothed to verity, as the sole heir of the mountain kingdom. fitz is poisoned and then submerged in a deep pool, a half-hearted attempt by regal to kill him. as fitz is on the verge of death, he manages to contact verity using the skill to help him destroy galen. he is rescued by his dog nosy, who was not killed by burrich but sent to the mountain kingdom as a gift to prince rurisk. the rescue from the pool by nosy left deep teeth marks in his hand that he comes to cherish as a sign of nosy's love and loyalty. nosy, being an old dog by this point, dies, leaving fitz lamenting about how his true master, rurisk, is dead, and how he \"gave his life freely, remembering that we were good to one another when we were puppies\" (in the words of fitz). fitz is healed by jonqui, king eyod's sister, afterward, and the closing pages of the book express fitz's deep sorrow over nosy's death during that event and the older narrator's pain at writing this.", "extra": {"variant": "clean-x-lower", "source": "Gemini"}, "uid": null}
