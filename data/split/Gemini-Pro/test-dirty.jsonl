{"id": 6002, "text": "The narrative commences in Spanish Guinea, where a French tourist encounters an injured man named Toundi, who soon passes away. The Frenchman discovers Toundi's diary, referred to by him as an \"exercise book.\" The remainder of the story is presented as the content of this diary that the Frenchman is supposedly reading. The Frenchman is never referenced again. The first \"exercise book\" introduces Toundi living with his family, where he is frequently beaten by his father. He eventually flees his home, seeking refuge with Father Gilbert, a local priest. His father attempts to persuade him to return, but Toundi refuses and ceases to acknowledge his birth parents. Toundi comes to see Father Gilbert as his new father. Father Gilbert educates Toundi in reading, writing, and Catholicism. Although initially a devout Catholic, Toundi's faith diminishes as the story progresses, until he ultimately loses his belief in God. Father Gilbert dies in a motorcycle accident a few months after meeting Toundi. Subsequently, Toundi goes to live with the Commandant, who is the authority figure in the colony, serving as a houseboy for him and later for Madame, the Commandant's wife. The events within the house become more significant to Toundi than his own life. Approximately six months after Toundi's arrival, Madame arrives from France, initially appearing as a warm, caring, and beautiful woman who attracts the attention of many men, much to the Commandant's annoyance. Shortly after her arrival, the Commandant departs on tour. Toundi is left with Madame to manage the house. Over time, Madame's demeanor towards Toundi becomes increasingly hostile and disrespectful. Upon the Commandant's return, Madame is depicted as a ruthless woman. During the Commandant's absence, she becomes bored and engages in an affair with M. Moreau, who is in charge of the prison and known for his brutality towards Africans. Toundi witnesses M. Moreau whipping two Africans nearly to death. The second exercise book begins. The Commandant's return follows the discovery of his wife's affair. A significant argument ensues, but they reconcile after a few days. Madame's disrespect towards Toundi intensifies, stemming from her dissatisfaction and her knowledge that he is aware of her affair. Sophie, the water engineer's lover, is falsely accused of stealing his workers' wages with Toundi's help. He is imprisoned and tortured to confess to a crime he did not commit. Toundi is confined in a hut near the police headquarters. Fortunately, he is aided by Mendim, a muscular man feared by many but who becomes Toundi's ally. M. Moreau orders Mendim to beat Toundi, but Mendim deceives him by throwing ox's blood on Toundi. They spend the day playing cards. Toundi falls ill, and Mendim takes him to the hospital. Due to the white doctor's promotion to captain, they must wait a long time to see the black doctor. The doctor discovers that Toundi's ribs are broken and have punctured his bronchi. While Toundi is in a dazed state at the hospital, M. Moreau returns with the white doctor, discussing further punishment for Toundi. After M. Moreau leaves, Toundi escapes the hospital, uncertain of where to go. By the end of the novel, Toundi's faith is so diminished that he abandons his belief in God.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6005, "text": "A study spanning two years suggests a trend of older individuals and women increasingly taking responsibility for safeguarding home computers from harmful online attacks.\n\nThe annual increase in women purchasing software for PC protection against viruses, spam, and spyware was 11.2% between 2002 and 2004. Preventon, a net security firm, conducted the study, indicating that security messages are reaching a wide range of internet users, with approximately 40% of home net security program buyers being retired individuals. This has risen by an average of 13.2% over the past three years, with retired women (53%) outnumbering retired men in purchasing security software. The research highlights shifting user stereotypes and demographics, alongside growing awareness of risks associated with high-speed broadband.\n\nThe study anticipates that 40% of home PC net security buyers in 2005 will be women and projects that women could become the primary buyers by 2007 if current trends persist. One woman over 60 who participated in the research stated that older people have become more vigilant about protecting their PCs, being more cautious and seeking insurance against potential problems.\n\nPaul Goosens, head of Preventon, mentioned to the BBC News website that young male computer users were the stereotype for the last 10 years. He goes on to say that now, the current users are real people of both sexes, very often women, who have more access at home. He also stated that net service providers still need to do more to educate people about online threats before they connect, particularly new broadband users.\n\nMr. Goosens suggested tailoring programs for dial-up users with slower connections, as well as ensuring user-friendly security software with simple interfaces, and clear, non-technical instructions. He also said that the nature of security threats are no longer just email viruses. High-profile concerns about rogue dialers, spyware, and programs that secretly install themselves on computers have increased awareness of the need for combined anti-virus, firewall, and spyware-removal programs. These programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally if there is no protection.\n\nA Symantec study from the previous year showed that over 30,000 PCs worldwide are added daily to networks spreading spam and viruses. Net security experts indicate that viruses designed to infect millions for headline news are becoming less common. Instead, programs are being released to directly benefit criminal groups, many based in Eastern Europe, rather than simply demonstrating technical skills or causing a nuisance. Mr. Goosens stated that the research reveals people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously due to increased press coverage. He explained that older users are becoming educated by the media and recognizing the threat, asking relevant questions, while younger users often naively assume safety due to using a reputable service provider. An unprotected computer with a broadband connection can be compromised and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. It is projected that over 30% of UK homes will have broadband net access by the end of the year.

The Indian company is expected to discuss buying part of some assets that were once part of Yukos and wants to buy part of Yuganskneftegas, an oil company. The former Yukos part was sold last year and was bought by Rosneft, a state-run energy company. India and Russia reportedly signed a deal on energy during a meeting between the chairman of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, the chairman of Gazprom, and India's petroleum minister. The agreement may lead to the companies creating refining locations in Russia, India, and other places, along with sending oil, gas, and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries in Asia. ONGC may put money into gas and oil fields located in Sakhalin, located in Russia's far east, and might also participate in bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea. India is trying to find new sources of energy, specifically liquefied natural gas, since the country's demand is growing quickly. The chairman of ONGC said the two companies could work together on bids starting next year. He also noted that his company's finances are doing well, saying Gazprom has a lot of gas while his company has money.

Image labels are treated as unobserved states, and determining those labels is framed as solving a maximum a posteriori (MAP) equation. All models use the same emission distribution, differing only in the assumed prior Markovian structure of the label field. This prior knowledge is represented by: a) a second-order anisotropic Markov Mesh and b) a standard isotropic Potts model. These models are used with three segmentation techniques: 2D Path Constrained Viterbi training for the Hidden Markov Mesh, Graph Cut segmentation for the first-order isotropic Potts model, and Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) for the second-order isotropic Potts model.\n\nThe three methods are presented in a consistent framework, with a focus on classification accuracy, examining the impacts of parameter estimation, computational speed, and automation level using metrics such as Overall Accuracy, Relative Improvement, and the Kappa coefficient for statistical analysis on both synthetic and real data obtained from Dental Diagnostic Radiography. With properly learned parameters, all algorithms perform well on images with clearly separated histogram modes, requiring minimal intervention.

This genetic modification, inherited from Bean, endowed them with extreme intelligence but also caused uncontrollable growth, likely leading to death by age 20. They had been traveling near light speed for a subjective five years, but on Earth, 421 years had elapsed, making it the year 2631. When they departed, scientists were actively seeking a cure for their giantism that wouldn't compromise their intelligence. Generations had passed, and they were largely forgotten, their mother and \"normal\" siblings having died centuries ago. The children had subjectively experienced only six years of life. Bean's life had been prolonged by the Herodotus's low gravity, which helped his heart function despite his immense size. At 4.5 meters tall, Bean remained prone in the cargo bay to avoid overexertion. He monitored the ship via his holo-top terminal, often prompting the children to hold secret meetings they believed he couldn't hear. Bean and Ender continued to study their genetic condition in hopes of a cure. In one of these clandestine meetings, Cincinnatus (nicknamed \"Sergeant\"), with his military mindset, attempted to recruit his siblings to kill their father, deeming him a resource drain. Carlotta, the sensitive engineer, hesitated to take a side, but Ender, a skilled biologist, punched Sergeant and broke his nose for suggesting such a thing, ending Sergeant's dominance. Ender and Carlotta revealed Sergeant's plans to Bean, who reprimanded all three children, reminding them of their equal intelligence. Sergeant had been imagining nonexistent threats to their security, believing the Giant intended to pass his soldier role to him. He studied Formic war videos, learned his father's strategies, and trained with weapons. Ender focused on the genetic studies, monitoring progress made by scientists on Earth. Carlotta, feeling somewhat excluded from the genetic research, served the family by managing every aspect of the spacecraft, as Bean was confined to the cargo hold. After despairing at their situation, and in light of the discovery that their condition could not be cured, Carlotta spotted an unknown spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit around an uncharted planet in the Goldilocks zone. Bean and his children debated their options. Changing course would require slowing down to turn, potentially killing Bean with the increased gravity. Moreover, the nature of the spacecraft was unknown; it could attack them, or they could pose a threat to the survival and progress of humanity. This idea was solidified when Sergeant deduced that the ship was a Formic Ark, a colony ship that had been traveling for centuries. Bean sent Sergeant alone to investigate the ship, and he escaped an attack by small Formic-like animals they called \"rabs.\" After this initial encounter, Bean revealed his full plan to his children. They were to find out who was piloting the ship and attempting to terraform the planet it orbited. It had been Bean's intention all along to have his children live on this planet and found their new species in safety as soon as he picked it up on radar as lying within the Goldilocks zone. Equipped with Sergeant's weapons and a sedative fog spray developed by Ender, Sergeant commanded defenses while Carlotta led their group to the helm, with Bean in constant communication. The spray proved effective, and they soon found the Hive Queen's chamber, discovering her and many workers dead. Eventually, they found living male Formics in one of the piloting helms. In an attempt to communicate, Ender surrendered himself by drifting close to them in zero gravity. The male drones approached and communicated with Ender through mental images. The group learned that the Ark had been sent long before Ender Wiggin, after whom Bean's son was named, eradicated the buggers. After the Queen on their ship died, the workers had died without her link, yet the males lived and tried to survive and keep the ship running despite losing numbers to the feral rabs. The group negotiated an agreement: if the children could eliminate the rabs, they could stay with the Formics and help cultivate the planet. When Bean learned from the male drones that Ender Wiggin was carrying a queen's cocoon looking for a home, and that Formic workers did have minds of their own contrary to popular belief, he demanded to speak with the Formics in order to warn Ender, despite risking his life in the journey. Accepting that his children had achieved beyond his wildest expectations, Bean risked his life by docking with the ark's cargo hold to float down into the ecotat. Laying in the grass and basking in the artificial sunlight, Bean communed for three days with the formic males. Though the Formics thought it was silly to believe the Queen would hide anything from them, Bean learned that workers could rebel against a Queen and regain their free will. After sleeping, his children woke him informing him that by studying how the Hive Queen suppresses her workers, Ender devised and administered a virus that will develop an organelle to shut off their growth genome, leaving their intelligence intact. With renewed hope for the future, Bean looked at the beauty around him and remember all those whom he loved and who loved him in his life. With his children's help, he stood at four and a half meters for the first time in years, and walks with belabored breathing in the sunlight.

He expressed satisfaction with his start in Spain, noting England's importance to him but uncertainty about playing there again. Owen, who transferred from Liverpool, has scored 11 goals for Real but hasn't displaced Raul or Ronaldo in the starting lineup. He conveyed delight with his time in Spain and refuted criticism of his decision to join Real, recalling initial skepticism about his role as a perceived fourth-choice striker. He countered the notion of being constantly benched, stating he's played as much as others this year, considering his initial position. Despite Newcastle's reported interest and speculation linking him to an England move, Owen said he's not yet ready to return. He affirmed his positive regard for the Premiership, where he initially gained recognition. He admitted to watching the Premiership frequently on television. When questioned about potentially returning to Liverpool, Owen stated he hasn't seriously considered it. He holds fond memories of Liverpool and stated it will always have a place in his heart, also feeling flattered by links to top English clubs. Overall, Owen stated he couldn't have asked for a better beginning in Madrid.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6023, "text": "Microscopy images use different channels to represent markers that stain a sample. Because the number of marker combinations varies widely, it is difficult to use deep learning segmentation models that need a specific channel combination for both training and future use. A recent method uses modality attention to address this, enabling effectiveness regardless of the marker combination. However, if a combination is not present in the training data, segmentation quality cannot be assessed during application. This absence hinders quality control and the ability to direct additional labeling and imaging. Here, we suggest a method for predicting segmentation quality on unlabeled images, using both types of uncertainty in neural networks for image segmentation and using a Random Forest model to relate these uncertainties to segmentation metrics. Furthermore, we show that using these uncertainty measures during training enhances segmentation performance.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

His mother, Doris, influenced his musical inclination with recordings by Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine, and Louis Armstrong; his grandfather, Augustus Theodore Dupree, a former big band musician, inspired him to learn guitar. He reconnected with Mick Jagger, a primary school acquaintance, during his teenage years, discovering their mutual passion for blues. In the early 1960s, Richards relocated to a London apartment with Jagger and Brian Jones. The Rolling Stones, also consisting of Bill Wyman, Ian Stewart, and Charlie Watts, formed in 1962, performing at venues like Ealing Jazz Club and the Crawdaddy Club. The book documents Richards's career with the Stones since 1962, tracing their development from intimate performances to large concerts, Richards's substance abuse, his legal issues, and his personal relationships with women such as Anita Pallenberg, Marianne Faithfull, Ronnie Spector, and Patti Hansen, whom he married in 1983. The often strained dynamics between Richards and Jagger are revisited in the story, garnering considerable media attention. The narrative emphasizes Richards's passion for music, his unique playing approach, and his method of creating chords.

To control nature, one must follow its laws, and these laws, when observed, become rules for action.\n\nIV.\nHumans can only combine or separate existing natural things, while nature itself performs the inner workings to bring about effects.\n\nV.\nMechanics, mathematicians, physicians, alchemists, and magicians all study nature for practical purposes, but currently with limited effort and success.\n\nVI.\nIt's illogical to anticipate unprecedented accomplishments without employing previously untested methods.\n\nVII.\nThe outputs of human thought and action seem plentiful in texts and products, yet this diversity stems from minor refinements and extensions of established knowledge, rather than from a large number of core principles.\n\nVIII.\nExisting knowledge is more often the result of chance and trial rather than systematic science; current sciences primarily organize and present existing knowledge, instead of offering means to invent or create anew.\n\nIX.\nThe root of problems in science lies in our tendency to overvalue the mind's inherent capabilities while failing to seek external assistance.\n\nX.\nNature\u2019s intricacies far surpass the capacity of our senses and intellect, rendering many common musings and interpretations irrelevant, though this often goes unnoticed.\n\nXI.\nCurrent sciences don't facilitate new discoveries, and contemporary logic doesn't lead to new scientific fields.\n\nXII.\nPrevailing logic tends to solidify errors rooted in common assumptions rather than promoting the pursuit of truth, causing more harm than good.\n\nXIII.\nThe syllogism isn't useful for examining the foundational ideas of science, and it struggles with intermediate concepts, unable to capture nature's subtleties; it secures agreement to an idea but doesn't grasp the reality behind it.\n\nXIV.\nSyllogisms are built from propositions, propositions use words, and words symbolize ideas; thus, if the underlying ideas are unclear and hastily derived from facts, the entire system is unsound, and true progress relies on accurate inductive reasoning.\n\nXV.\nOur fundamental concepts, whether logical or physical, are flawed; notions like substance, quality, and essence, and even more specific terms, are poorly defined and unreliable.\n\nXVI.\nOur understanding of specific species like humans or dogs, and direct sensory perceptions like hot or cold, are relatively reliable, but still can be muddled by constant change and mixing; most other concepts used are merely deviations from the truth because they aren't properly developed from facts.\n\nXVII.\nErrors in forming general scientific principles are as prevalent as errors in forming basic concepts, even when using common induction, but especially when using syllogistic reasoning to arrive at lower-level statements.\n\nXVIII.\nScientific progress has been limited to readily apparent observations. To truly explore nature's depths, we need concepts and axioms derived from reality through a more reliable and cautious method, and a completely enhanced way of intellectual processing.\n\nXIX.\nThere are only two approaches to finding and revealing truth: one ascends from specific observations to broad principles, treating these principles as established truths and then applying them to discover intermediate ideas, a method that is popular; the other derives principles from sensory experience and specific observations, gradually building towards the broadest generalizations, which is the correct approach, though yet untried.\n\nXX.\nThe mind, when left to its own devices, gravitates toward the same method as traditional logic, preferring broad generalizations for a sense of certainty and quickly losing interest in experimentation, a problem amplified by the formal nature of logic.\n\nXXI.\nAn independent, patient, and thoughtful mind, particularly if free from ingrained beliefs, may tentatively explore the correct method, but progresses little because the unaided mind lacks the capacity to overcome the ambiguity of things.\n\nXXII.\nBoth methods begin with senses and specific details and conclude with the highest level generalities, but they differ immensely: one barely considers experiment and specifics, while the other carefully examines them; one begins by creating vague and useless generalities, while the other progresses step-by-step to what is naturally more basic and evident.\n\nXXIII.\nThere is a stark difference between the mind\u2019s illusions and divine Ideas, which means between flawed belief systems and the true, inherent indicators found in nature's creations.\n\nXXIV.\nPrinciples based on debate are ineffective for new discoveries because nature's complexity exceeds the subtlety of argument, whereas principles accurately developed from specifics readily uncover new details, making sciences productive.\n\nXXV.\nCurrent principles, drawn from limited and unsystematic experiences and only a few general cases, are tailored to fit those instances; therefore, they fail to lead to new insights, and when faced with contradictory evidence, these principles are defended with trivial distinctions instead of being revised.\n\nXXVI.\nReason as typically applied to natural phenomena I call \"Anticipations of Nature,\" which implies a premature conclusion. Reason derived from facts through a sound, systematic method I call \"Interpretation of Nature.\"\n\nXXVII.\nAnticipations provide a seemingly solid foundation for agreement, because people who share the same errors can easily concur.\n\nXXVIII.\nAnticipations are more persuasive than interpretations because they are drawn from familiar and few instances, readily influencing the understanding and imagination, while interpretations, collected from diverse and widespread facts, are not easily grasped and seem inconsistent with prevailing opinions, much like matters of faith.\n\nXXIX.\nAnticipations and logic are useful in sciences based on opinions because their purpose is to compel agreement rather than to understand reality.\n\nXXX.\nEven if all brilliant minds combined their efforts over time, no significant scientific progress can be made using anticipations, as fundamental errors in initial thinking can't be corrected by later refinements.\n\nXXXI.\nExpecting significant progress by adding new elements to old sciences is futile; a complete restart from the ground up is needed to avoid repeating the same limited and unproductive cycle.\n\nXXXII.\nThe reputation of past thinkers remains untarnished because I am comparing approaches, not individual abilities; I am acting as a guide, not a judge.\n\nXXXIII.\nMy method and its resulting discoveries cannot be properly evaluated using current reasoning methods (anticipations) because the very standards used for judgment are themselves being questioned.\n\nXXXIV.\nEven explaining my ideas is difficult, because new concepts will be interpreted through the lens of old ones.\n\nXXXV.\nLike the French entering Italy with chalk to mark lodgings, I want my ideas to be received by those capable of understanding them, rather than forcing acceptance through debate, which is ineffective when questioning fundamental principles.\n\nXXXVI.\nThe only way to convey my approach is to directly guide people to specific facts in their order, while they temporarily set aside their preconceived notions and familiarize themselves with reality.\n\nXXXVII.\nThose who deny the possibility of attaining certainty share an initial similarity with my approach, but ultimately diverge significantly. While they claim knowledge is impossible, I argue that current methods yield limited knowledge, but instead of undermining our senses and understanding, I seek to provide them with support.\n\nXXXVIII.\nThe false beliefs deeply rooted in the human mind obstruct the entry of truth and will resurface during the renewal of sciences unless people are warned and prepared to resist them.\n\nXXXIX.\nThere are four categories of these false beliefs, which I call Idols of the Tribe, Cave, Market-place, and Theatre.\n\nXL.\nForming ideas and principles through accurate induction is the proper way to prevent and eliminate idols; identifying these idols is crucial because the doctrine of Idols is to interpreting nature what the doctrine of exposing fallacies is to common logic.\n\nXLI.\nIdols of the Tribe are inherent to human nature and the human race itself. The senses aren't a reliable measure of reality; rather, our senses and minds perceive things in relation to ourselves, distorting reality by mixing it with our own nature.\n\nXLII.\nIdols of the Cave are individual biases; each person has a \"cave\" that distorts natural light due to their unique nature, upbringing, interactions, reading, admired authorities, or state of mind, thus, human perception varies and is subject to chance; Heraclitus noted that people search for knowledge within their own limited perspectives instead of in the broader world.\n\nXLIII.\nIdols of the Market-place arise from human interaction and language, as words are created and used based on common understanding. Flawed word choices hinder comprehension, and even scholarly attempts to clarify don't solve the problem; words often dominate understanding, leading to pointless arguments and fantasies.\n\nXLIV.\nIdols of the Theatre stem from philosophical dogmas and flawed reasoning methods; I see established systems as staged plays presenting artificial worlds, and this applies not only to current and ancient systems, but also to potential future ones because very different errors can arise from similar causes. The term applies to entire systems and to principles and axioms received through tradition, gullibility, and carelessness. These Idols will be discussed in detail to properly caution the understanding.\n\nXLV.\nThe human mind instinctively imposes more order and regularity on the world than actually exists. Despite nature\u2019s irregularities, we invent parallels and connections where none exist, like presuming perfect circular orbits or creating an element of fire to complete a symmetrical system. These biases affect not only beliefs but also fundamental concepts.\n\nXLVI.\nOnce the mind adopts an opinion, it interprets everything to support it, ignoring or dismissing contradictory evidence to maintain its original conclusions, a phenomenon seen in superstitions where fulfilled events are noted and failures are overlooked. This bias subtly infiltrates philosophy and science, where initial conclusions shape subsequent ones, regardless of their soundness. Affirmative instances unduly sway the intellect more than negative ones, but negative instances are more important for establishing axioms.\n\nXLVII.\nThe human intellect is most affected by immediate and striking things, assuming other things are similar, even without proof; it avoids the effort of exploring diverse instances needed to test axioms unless forced by strict methods.\n\nXLVIII.\nThe restless human mind cannot stop searching, leading to unprovable concepts like the world having a limit, or eternity flowing to the present; distinctions between past and future infinity are flawed, as they suggest one infinity is larger and that infinity can diminish; the mind's inability to stop also causes problems in finding causes, as it seeks ultimate causes even for fundamental principles, which should simply be accepted as they are, leading to reliance on final causes related to human nature rather than the universe's; however, it is as poor to seek a cause for what is general as to not do so for lesser things.\n\nXLIX.\nThe human understanding is influenced by will and emotion, creating biased sciences. We more readily believe what we prefer to be true, rejecting difficult things due to impatience, sober ideas due to their limiting nature, deep natural concepts from superstition, and practical experience out of arrogance, and beliefs differing from popular opinion due to deference. Emotions subtly affect understanding in countless ways.\n\nL.\nThe senses' limitations cause the greatest distortions to understanding. Immediate sensations outweigh less obvious but more important information, so observation stops where sight ends. Hidden processes within tangible bodies and minute changes in substances go unnoticed; however, these must be explored to advance practical achievements in nature. Furthermore, the nature of air and less dense substances is largely unknown. Senses alone are unreliable, and improved sensory instruments offer limited help; true interpretation of nature requires appropriate instances and experiments where senses judge only the experiment, and the experiment reveals natural facts.\n\nLI.\nThe human understanding tends to abstract and give substance to fleeting concepts. It is more helpful to dissect nature into parts than to abstract it, as Democritus\u2019s school did. Focus should be on matter, its arrangement, changes, simple actions, and laws of motion, because forms are mental constructs, unless laws of action are considered forms.\n\nLII.\nThe Idols of the Tribe stem from the uniform nature of the human spirit, its biases, limitations, restlessness, influence of emotions, sensory shortcomings, and manner of perception.\n\nLIII.\nIdols of the Cave stem from individual mental and physical traits and from upbringing, habits, and chance. Many exist, but I will discuss the most important for cautioning the understanding.\n\nLIV.\nPeople become attached to particular sciences because they believe they invented them or have devoted significant effort to them. When turning to philosophy, they skew it to fit their prior beliefs, exemplified by Aristotle making natural philosophy subservient to logic, and chemists building fantastic philosophies from limited furnace experiments; similarly, Gilbert created an entire system based on the study of magnets.\n\nLV.\nA key difference between minds in science is that some readily note differences, while others note similarities. The precise mind focuses on subtle distinctions, while the broad mind finds general connections; both can err by focusing too much on fine points or superficial resemblances.\n\nLVI.\nSome excessively admire the past, while others crave novelty, with few finding a balance; this harms science by making judgments based on preference rather than seeking truth in eternal nature and experience. These biases should be rejected to prevent undue influence on the intellect.\n\nLVII.\nConcentrating on nature or simple forms disrupts the understanding, while considering composite forms overwhelms it; this is seen in the difference between the school of Democritus, which focused on particles to the exclusion of structure, and other philosophies that admired structure and failed to examine simplicity; contemplation should alternate between these to make the understanding both penetrating and comprehensive and avoid the pitfalls mentioned.\n\nLVIII.\nProvide prudence and contemplation to avoid Idols of the Cave, which mostly arise from favoring a subject, excessive comparison or distinction, partiality for certain times, or object sizes. Students of nature should suspect whatever they enjoy most, being careful to keep their understanding even and clear.\n\nLIX.\nIdols of the Market-place, entering understanding through language, are the most troublesome. People believe reason governs words, but words also influence understanding, making science sophistical and inactive. Words, formed by common people, follow obvious lines of division. When a sharper mind seeks to adjust these lines to nature, words resist, resulting in debates about language, which mathematicians would better begin with, defining terms. Definitions, however, don't solve the problem in material subjects because they use words, and a return to specific instances in series is needed, as I will explain in the method for forming concepts and axioms.\n\nLX.\nIdols imposed by language are of two types: names for nonexistent things (from fantasy), and names for existing things that are confused and poorly defined. Examples of the first are Fortune, Prime Mover, and Element of Fire, born of false theories. These idols are easily removed by rejecting all theories as obsolete. The second type, stemming from faulty abstraction, is more complex; consider \"humid,\" used for things that spread, are indeterminate, yield, divide, unite, flow, cling, or liquefy. Flame, air, dust, or glass may be humid, depending on the sense of the word, showing that the notion comes from a poorly verified abstraction of water and liquids. There are levels of distortion in words. Names of substances, particularly well-defined low species, are least faulty, actions are more faulty, and qualities are most faulty (except for direct sensory perceptions); in all cases, more varied human senses yield better notions.\n\nLXI.\nIdols of the Theatre aren't innate or secret; they enter the mind openly from philosophical systems and distorted demonstration rules. Refuting them is inconsistent, as we disagree on principles and demonstrations, which preserves the ancients' honor, as the issue is the way, not the ability, and the more active and swift one is in a wrong way, the further one goes astray. My method leaves little to the intellect, leveling all minds; like drawing a straight line with a rule instead of freehand, my plan relies less on skill. While detailed refutations are useless, I must discuss the sects, their signs of unsoundness, and the causes of misfortune and lasting agreement in error, to ease the path to truth and encourage the understanding to dismiss idols.\n\nLXII.\nThere are many Idols of the Theatre, and more are possible. If religion and civil governments hadn't discouraged new ideas, many philosophical sects like those among the Greeks would have arisen. Just as many hypotheses can be formed about the heavens, so can many dogmas be established in philosophy. In this philosophical theater, stories are more compact and elegant than real ones, and philosophy is based on either many things out of few, or little out of many, so it's based on too narrow a foundation of experiment and natural history and decides on too few cases. The Rational School takes common instances from experience, vaguely ascertained and examined, and leaves the rest to wit. Another class carefully experiments on a few things and constructs systems, forcing other facts to fit. A third mixes philosophy with theology, some seeking the origin of sciences among spirits, so this parent stock of errors - this false philosophy - is Sophistical, Empirical, and Superstitious.\n\nLXIII.\nAristotle exemplifies the first class, corrupting natural philosophy with logic, forming the world from categories, giving the soul a genus from second-intention words, explaining density with act and power, asserting single bodies have single motion, and imposing restrictions, being more concerned with answering and affirming than with inner truth, best shown when compared with other Greek systems, which have some savor of nature, experience, and bodies, while Aristotle's physics only use logical words, which are handled again in his metaphysics. Although his books deal with experiments, he concluded before consulting experience, which he bends to fit his will, making him more guilty than the schoolmen who abandoned experience.\n\nLXIV.\nThe Empirical school creates dogmas more deformed than the Sophistical because it is based on narrow experiments instead of common notions. Such a philosophy seems probable to those constantly involved with the experiments, and incredible to others. The alchemists and Gilbert exemplify this. However, if my warnings rouse men to experiment and abandon sophistical doctrines, there may be danger from this type of philosophy, against which we should prepare.\n\nLXV.\nSuperstition and theology widely corrupt philosophy, harming entire systems or parts. The human understanding is susceptible to imagination as well as common notions, with sophistical philosophy ensnaring and the fanciful type flattering and misleading. People have intellectual ambition, exemplified in Pythagoras, and Plato and his subtle school; it also appears in abstract forms, final causes, and first causes, omitting intermediate causes. Caution is needed, as the apotheosis of error is mischievous, and vanity becoming venerated is a plague. Some moderns have lightly tried to found natural philosophy on Genesis, Job, and sacred writings, seeking the dead among the living, making repression important because this mixture creates a fantastic philosophy and heretical religion, so we must be sober and give to faith only what is faith's.\n\nLXVI.\nSo much for the harmful authorities of systems founded on common notions, few experiments, or superstition. It remains to discuss faulty subject matter in contemplation, especially natural philosophy. The understanding is infected by mechanics, where body alteration is through composition, imagining similar processes in universal nature, leading to the fiction of elements and their formation of natural bodies. When contemplating free nature, man finds species of animals, plants, minerals, leading to the belief in primary forms that nature intends to produce, with remaining variety from hindrances or transplanting. The former leads to primary qualities, the latter to occult properties and specific virtues, which divert from more solid pursuits. Physicians better focus on secondary qualities and operations, but for the elementary qualities and specific virtues, they corrupt observations, either reducing them to first qualities or not following them to later qualities, halting prematurely. Such powers should be sought in changes of all bodies, not just human medicines. It is worse to contemplate quiescent principles from which things are made rather than moving principles through which things are produced because the former leads to discourse and the latter to works. Vulgar motion distinctions in natural philosophy are of little value, only indicating how far change goes. Even causes of motion are introduced with negligence, distinguishing between natural and violent motion drawn entirely from vulgar notions, since all violent motion is natural, with an external agent simply setting nature to work. A true physical kind of motion would note bodies desiring mutual contact, resuming natural dimensions, or congregating towards kindred masses.\n\nIt is also bad to spend time on first principles and highest generalities instead of things intermediate. Men abstract nature to potential matter, and dissect it to atoms, which are of little use to mankind even if true.\n\nLXVII.\nThe understanding must be cautioned against the intemperance in giving or withholding assent in systems, which can establish and perpetuate Idols. This excess is in those who decide quickly, making science dogmatic, and those who deny knowledge, leading to aimless inquiry, with the former subduing and the latter weakening the understanding. Aristotle destroyed all other philosophies with hostile refutations and laid down laws, raising and disposing of new questions to leave nothing uncertain, a practice used by his successors. Plato introduced Acatalepsia in jest, disdaining older sophists, but the New Academy made it a dogma, saying they allowed following probable things, but not maintaining truths. However, when the mind despairs of finding truth, interest weakens, leading to wandering disputations and discourses rather than severe inquiry. The human senses and understanding, though weak, should not be deprived of authority, but be given helps.\n\nLXVIII.\nSo much for the classes of Idols and their followers; all must be renounced with a fixed resolve, and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed, since entering the kingdom of man through science is similar to entering heaven, where none enter except as a child.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6050, "text": "Federal authorities will determine if they should allow the selling of pain medications thought to be associated with increased chances of cardiac arrest and strokes. An FDA group will make their recommendation after a three-day information gathering period. These pain drugs, called COX-2 inhibitors, are sold under names like Celebrex and Vioxx. Although Vioxx was removed from stores last year, the Merck company might sell it again if the FDA gives their approval. The FDA is assessing if the advantages for individuals outweigh the amplified hazards. If Vioxx returns, Merck's profits would likely rise and legal issues may be easier to handle with individuals who claim they were injured by the medicine, according to analysts. Merck stopped Vioxx sales voluntarily on September 30, which resulted in the company's fourth-quarter earnings declining to $1.1 billion, from $1.4 billion during the previous year. News of the removal caused Merck's stock values to drop by over 10%, and the company has allotted millions of dollars to take care of lawsuits related to Vioxx. A research paper named Approve generated concerns after showing that the risk of heart attacks and strokes doubled for patients taking the drug for a minimum of 18 months. Drug companies, including Merck and Pfizer, created Cox-2 inhibitors, because they generate less stomach issues for users compared to other painkillers. Pfizer is still selling their Celebrex and Bextra medications, even though investigations imply they may also damage the heart. The potential reintroduction of Vioxx, announced by Merck, surprised analysts. Peter Kim, the head of research for Merck, stated that they took Vioxx off the market \"based on the information available at the time, understanding that there were alternative treatments.\" He added that things have since been updated based on new reports.

Dr. Graham presented calculations to the US Senate in November indicating that Vioxx may be linked to around 56,000 American deaths. Facing harsh criticism regarding its management of the Vioxx matter, the FDA announced on Tuesday that they will establish an independent group to monitor the safety of drugs that are already being sold.

{"id": 6061, "text": "Government proposals would give elderly and disabled individuals control over how funds allocated for their personal care are used and managed.\nAccording to ministers, care decisions should be made by elderly and disabled individuals, not social workers, to enable them to remain in their homes. Plans also include establishing a senior official for adult services in each English region to improve cooperation among different organizations. However, the government rejected calls from opponents for free long-term care.\nThere are 1.7 million people in England who require care, and ministers predict that this number may quadruple by 2050. A consultation paper for social care for adults in England, released on Monday, aims to eliminate a system that fosters dependency. Health Minister Stephen Ladyman stated that the document is the opposite of excessive government control.\nHe stated that the goal is to transfer authority from the government to individuals, stating that while the government will assist in making decisions, it will no longer make them on their behalf. The government has already authorized local councils to provide funds to individuals to directly pay for their services, but the adoption of this program has been \"disappointing.\"\nMinisters claim that the new proposals would simplify direct payments and address some local councils' reluctance to use them. They also intend to create a new \"half-way house\" where social workers inform individuals of the available funding for their care and assist them in selecting how to allocate that \"individual budget.\" The initiative will be financed by existing budgets set until 2008. However, Mr. Ladyman stated that the proposals may result in savings in some areas, such as by freeing up NHS beds and preventing diseases. He rejected free personal care in England, which is available in Scotland and Wales, claiming that it was \"unsustainable.\"\nAccording to David Rogers of the Local Government Association, agencies are already collaborating on the kind of innovation the government has proposed. Tony Hunter, President of the Association of Directors of Social Services, stated that the proposals could improve the dignity and well-being of thousands of individuals. However, Age Concern argued that social care is chronically underfunded and that older people are being offered choice in theory, but not in practice. Its Director General, Gordon Lishman, stated that \"Direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.\"\nThe Tories believe that those who pay for three years of long-term care, either directly or through insurance, should be guaranteed free care for the remainder of their lives. Tory spokesman Simon Burns stated that over 80,000 long-term care positions have been lost since 1997. \"After eight years of persistent change, dogmatic enforcement of regulation, and overbearing government initiatives - we need action, not a vision,\" Mr. Burns stated. The Lib Dems propose to fund free personal care by imposing a new 50% tax rate on incomes exceeding \u00a3100,000. Health spokesman Paul Burstow stated, \"Promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share. However, there is a risk that independence will become isolation if the necessary support and care are not available.\"", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The invasion of Afghanistan, it claims, was pre-planned with British assistance, not a reaction to September 11th. The book suggests that President Bush used religious groups to justify a campaign against Islam, aligning with the \"Clash of Civilizations\" theory. The \"war on terror,\" according to the book, was simply an excuse to curtail personal freedoms in the U.S. and allied countries to establish a military dictatorship. It alleges that Osama bin Laden was a creation of the CIA and continued to serve American intelligence. It also posits that the bin Laden and Bush families jointly manage their finances through the Carlyle Group. The book argues that the U.S. government was seized by powerful industries (weapons, oil, pharmaceuticals), whose interests would be prioritized.

However, differences between simulated and actual visual data make it hard to directly apply models trained in simulations to real-world situations. This paper introduces a design to handle this issue. The design divides the learning model into separate perception and control parts, using semantic image segmentation to link them. The perception part converts images into semantic image segmentation. The control part is a reinforcement learning agent that acts based on the image segmentation. The architecture was tested with obstacle avoidance and target following tasks. The results of the experiments show that the architecture is better than the baseline methods in both virtual and real-world scenarios, with a faster learning process. A thorough analysis of various alternative configurations validates how well this design can be transferred.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

It is like dew before it forms droplets, or the fragrance within a flower, or something unseen that permeates everything, becoming its vital energy, essence, and spirit.\n\nThis force reawakens old desires, causing warm feelings to spread across the landscape.  Half-remembered sounds and scents evoke memories of childhood and its joys from their long-hidden places.\n\nNow, with an intensity never before felt, it compels me to respond, not as something limited to the mind's perception, subject to its limitations, but as something absolute and transcendent.  It is often encountered like gentle lights peering from distant horizons behind the colorful edges of clouds at dusk.\n\nIn this renewal of the year, when someone lingers by woodland streams, absorbed in youthful concerns, nature seems to comment on their worries, joys, and dreams.  This person becomes unified with everything under the sky, sharing in its laughter and sighs.\n\nIt flows through the fragrant air, blessing the fields and creating wonder everywhere.\n\nThis Spirit of Beauty, like a dawn's light across the sea, alone can fill the mind with divine inspiration, representing the essential loveliness of the world.  One dedicated to it will not be distracted by trivial pursuits, nor break the enchantment that first awakened them to its secret allure, guiding them across the earth to follow its sweet surprises and endless miracles.\n\nOn summer afternoons, when faint silver paths like moonlight appear on the glassy ocean, and distant clouds resemble battlements drawn to the peak of a high place; when autumn twilight fades on barren hills and the winds are calm, he watches for the rising of winter stars in the East.  In such moments, he feels its presence nearby and stands in awe.\n\nStarry nights spent wandering alone have marked his face.  He has combined vows with the sounds of wind, wood, torrents, and rain, binding him to its service until its ultimate delight is known.\n\nI, too, among those who follow its path, have given up my inheritance for artistic expression, adopting a simple, humble way of life.  From the earliest memory of my childhood home, surrounded by trees, where its enchantment first touched my imagination with a beautiful glow, my heart has been moved by its influence.\n\nOften, for a brief moment, the barrier to infinite possibilities seems to tremble, offering a glimpse beyond mortal senses.  I have stood, possessed, like one who might see a nature deity in a fern-filled valley, flooded with unusual light and cosmic passion.  Whether walking through mountains with wind and clouds, or wandering through cities, captivated by glances and unspoken greetings, I have sought eternal loveliness in everything that reflects divinity.\n\nIf ever a prophetic joy crossed my face, it was the belief that only love of this beauty is needed for humanity to experience a joy beyond what poets have imagined.  Those touched by it, who love it in all its forms, need no difficult path to find happiness within, only to appreciate nature's beauty and embrace the emotions it inspires.\n\nThe idea that it could be a complete guide for its follower has stayed with me, adding depth to solitary vigils by shores and walks by streams.\n\nYouthful passions fade, and recognition comes slowly.  But this is dependable where everything else is not.\n\nSolace and inspiration, it can surprise a weary spirit with unexpected grandeur, as long as evening light reveals its presence in the sky after rain, or as long as distant landscapes evoke a sense of wonder.\n\nAs long as a breath of fresh air can bring joy, let it be my devotion and desire. Let its paths be my journey, and my senses be attuned to its every expression.\n\nOften, may the fading afternoon find me awaiting the rising of the transparent moon in the distance. Often, may I be awakened in the dewy grass at dawn by forest birdsong, eager for the day ahead in unexplored hills and valleys.\n\nGive me the open road, a lover of chance encounters and roadside companions, often pausing by farms to admire the distant views, or in twilit valleys filled with the sound of mountain streams, above the plains where coastal towns gleam.\n\nI have gone too far to turn back. My heart longs for undiscovered wonders. Be my refuge still, you stars, clouds, horizons, and winds filled with joy!\n\nThough hardship may come, and others may criticize, you never will. The beauty of the sky can never fail.\n\nYou, who nurtured my childhood and youth with such beauty and visions, have always known that my ventures are driven by a thirst for beauty, despite my failings.

Roarke informs Eve that Mirina's fiance is involved in a gambling and prostitution scandal and that he sold the casino associated with it the day after Towers' death. Another victim, Yvonne Metcalf, is found murdered with the same methods, and her shoe is missing. C. J. Morse is at the scene, filming the body and mentioning Metcalf's past relationship with Roarke. Unable to find connections between the victims, Eve consults Dr. Charlotte Mira, who suggests that the killer hates women and seeks fame. Mira points out the victims' connections to Roarke, leading Eve to question if Roarke could be the killer. Mira assures her that she is not involved with a murderer. Eve recounts her past trauma in Dallas. After trying to relax, Eve goes to Roarke's house and interviews him about Metcalf. After a tense exchange, Roarke locks the door. Eve shows Roarke that she is wearing the diamond, tells him that she will move in with him, and says that she loves him. Eve tells Roarke that the killer is targeting famous women, and they decide to use Eve as bait. Roarke surprises Eve by creating a suite for her that connects to his office. Eve investigates Randall Slade's gambling debts, David Angelini's business failures and debts, and a large transfer of money from Mrs. Whitney to David. Whitney is furious when Eve and Feeney say they need to interview his wife. Eve invites Mavis over, shocking Summerset. That night, Louise Kirski, one of Nadine's editors, is murdered wearing Nadine's raincoat, and C. J. Morse discovers the body. Security tapes show that David Angelini was at the scene of the crime, and he also had a failed business deal with Yvonne Metcalf. During his interview, he tries to bribe Eve and claims he witnessed Kirski's murder. Eve arrests him, and Whitney asks her to release him, but Eve refuses, and Whitney dismisses her. A knife covered in blood is found at Angelini's house, and Marco Angelini falsely confesses to the murder. Whitney tries to apologize to Eve, but she rejects it and leaves. Eve and Roarke go to Mexico for a night. The lab results show that David's knife was not the murder weapon. The new police chief, Harrison Tibble, orders her to release David and Marcus due to lack of evidence and lightly rebukes Eve and Whitney for their emotional involvement. Afterward, Eve learns that Nadine is missing. Eve reviews Morse's police interview and realizes that he lied about how he found Louise Kirski's body. Further investigation suggests that Morse may have murdered his mother. At the studio, Morse is missing. Eve asks Peabody to back her up, and they search Morse's apartment, where Peabody finds the missing umbrella and shoe. While waiting for news on Morse or Nadine at Roarke's fundraiser, Eve receives a call from Morse, who is holding Nadine hostage. She leaves without telling anyone, and Roarke follows her. During the fight with Morse, Eve loses the advantage, but Roarke intervenes and saves her, stabbing Morse in the throat. Roarke proposes to Eve as they leave the scene. In a later book, Morse is supposed to be on trial for his crimes.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6086, "text": "Annotating 3D medical images at the voxel level is expensive in terms of labor and expert knowledge, which means that most standard datasets only have annotations for a limited number of organs or tumors, creating partial labeling. A dynamic on-demand network (DoDNet) is introduced to segment multiple organs and tumors on these datasets. The DoDNet architecture includes a shared encoder-decoder, a task encoding module, a controller to create dynamic convolution filters, and a dynamic segmentation head. The task encoding module encodes information about the current segmentation task. Unlike other approaches that use fixed kernels after training, DoDNet's dynamic head uses kernels generated adaptively by the controller, based on both the input image and the assigned task. This allows DoDNet to segment multiple organs and tumors as well as multiple networks or a multi-head network, but more efficiently and flexibly. A large, partially labeled dataset called MOTS was created, and DoDNet outperformed other methods on seven organ and tumor segmentation tasks. Weights pre-trained on MOTS were also transferred to another multi-organ segmentation task, resulting in state-of-the-art performance. This research offers a pre-trained 3D medical image segmentation model that can be fine-tuned and applied to other volumetric medical data segmentation tasks.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6089, "text": "It's crucial to measure uncertainty in medical image segmentation because it impacts critical decisions. There have been significant efforts to measure uncertainty in image segmentation models by, for example, learning a density segmentation model based on the input image. Common approaches limit these learnt densities to Gaussian distributions. We suggest using Normalizing Flows (NFs), a more adaptable method that allows for more intricate learnt densities and more precise uncertainty modeling. We demonstrate this by using the Probabilistic U-Net and enhancing the posterior density with an NF, making it more expressive. Our qualitative and quantitative (GED and IoU) assessments on the LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation datasets, which are multi-annotated and single-annotated, respectively, demonstrate a notable improvement. This is especially evident in the measurement of aleatoric uncertainty and the enhanced predictive performance of up to 14 percent. This finding strongly suggests considering a more flexible density model in architectures aiming to capture segmentation ambiguity via density modeling. The advantage of this improved modeling will increase confidence in annotation and segmentation and encourage the technology's practical application.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6106, "text": "The narrative begins with a passage from Howard Alan Treesong's youthful writings, detailing the Seven Paladins central to his fictional world. Gersen's quest to find Treesong starts with information from a police contact about the criminal's recent inactivity. Treesong, who once styled himself \"Lord of the Overmen\" and nearly headed the IPCC, is admired for his ambition by Gersen, who suspects he is planning something big.\n\nTreesong's empire is managed by Jehan Addels and includes Cosmopolis magazine, where he uses the alias \"Henry Lucas.\" Gersen combs through the magazine's files and finds a photograph of a dinner with \"H A Treesong is here\" written on it, the only known image of Treesong, although the woman who sold it to the magazine was murdered. Unable to identify Treesong in the picture, Gersen creates Extant magazine and offers a contest with cash prizes to identify the people in the photograph. Alice Wroke is hired to process entries, but Gersen suspects her of being a spy after a lie detector test.\n\nEventually, all but one person in the photograph is identified. When a contestant correctly identifies everyone, Gersen reveals to Alice that he is looking for Treesong. The contest's information suggests the photograph is of Institute Fellows, including Dexad members, and the three Fellows of rank 99. All but one died at the banquet from poisoning, with Treesong being the survivor and murderer who fraudulently acquired rank 99 to become the Institute's leader.\n\nAlice's father, another Dexad member, was murdered by Treesong, who blackmailed Alice into spying using threats. Gersen rescues the last surviving Dexad member ahead of Treesong, shooting him in the leg. The new Triune revokes Treesong's rank, ending his plan.\n\nExtant receives a late contest entry identifying Treesong as \"Howard Hardoah,\" purportedly from his father, mentioning a school reunion. Treesong calls Extant, identifying the people in the photograph, but is told he is too late to win. \"Henry Lucas\" offers to publish his memoirs, but Treesong declines. Gersen suspects Treesong plans to attend the reunion and travels to Maunish.\n\nGersen interviews the elder Hardoah, learning about Treesong's childhood and his \"Book of Dreams\" from his brother Ledesmus, who sells it to Gersen. Gersen arranges for Treesong's former music teacher to perform at the reunion, with Gersen as an inept musician. Treesong arrives, humiliates his tormentors, and has Gersen thrown out for his poor playing.\n\nGersen disrupts Treesong's revenge but can only wound him again before fleeing. He learns from the Hardoahs that the Cleadhoes moved off-planet and their destination. Otho Cleadhoe was a township marmelizer, and still has the Book, which describes Treesong's \"Seven Paladins.\" Gersen learns from Alice that Treesong sees the Seven as aspects of himself.\n\nGersen uses the Book to lure Treesong out of hiding and enlists the help of Nymphotis Cleadhoe's parents, Otho and Tuty, who believe Howard killed their son. Cosmopolis publishes a report of Treesong's reunion antics and a letter from Tuty mentioning the exercise book, drawing Treesong's attention.\n\nThe Cleadhoes, now on Bethune Preserve, are visited by Treesong, who seeks his book. Tuty and Otho betray Gersen, leaving him and Alice behind. Gersen and Alice follow and arrive at Otho's laboratory, where Treesong is found marmelized from the legs down, facing Nymphotis's statue. Gersen reveals his motive for seeking Treesong's downfall.\n\nTreesong acknowledges his defeat, mourns his failed ambition, and asks to be left alone. Gersen refuses further revenge and leaves with Alice and the Cleadhoes. Gersen overhears a conversation between Treesong and his paladins, who convince him to give up. The paladins perform one last service before departing. Gersen finds Treesong drowned in a pond, unable to have done it himself due to being marmelized.

Regularization and arc length terms, common in level set methods, are incorporated to regularize and smooth the level set function. The model is expanded to multichannel and multiphase patterns to segment colorful images and images with multiple objects.

Jupiter stated that consumers don't want to sacrifice phone size and battery life for multimedia services, despite efforts to provide music download services on phones. Gartner released a separate study indicating that real-time TV broadcasts on phones in Europe are \"unlikely\" before 2007 because of technical and standards-related problems that need resolution. Batteries must already support video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras, and games, among other things. More demands on battery life will be placed by music download services based on the success of computer-based download services. Fifty percent of Europeans said that phone size was the most important factor when choosing a phone, but more power demands tend to mean larger phones. A Jupiter research mobile analyst, Thomas Husson, stated that mobile phone music services shouldn't be positioned to compete with the PC music experience because phones aren't ready. He said that mobile music services should be new and different, enabling operators to differentiate their brands and support third-generation network launches. Other problems facing mobile music include limited phone storage compared to portable players, which can store up to 40GB of music. The mobile industry is eager to enter music downloading after the success of Apple's iTunes, Napster, and other online music download services. As phones become smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to watch TV on the move. Services like TiVo To Go allow people to transfer pre-recorded TV content onto their phones in the US. However, the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests that direct broadcasting will have to wait. Several European operators, such as Italy's TIM and 3, currently offer TV-like services where clips are downloaded. According to the report, mobile TV must overcome several barriers before its widespread adoption. Globally, various standards and methods of transmitting TV signals to phones are being developed. Trials in Berlin and Helsinki are using terrestrial TV masts to broadcast compressed signals to phones with extra receivers in Europe. The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation has a service that allows people to watch TV programs on their phones 24 hours a day, using 3GP technology, which is one of the standards for mobile TV. The European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe at the end of 2004. Operators will work on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. The cost and infrastructure needed to set up the services must be addressed. Handsets also need to work with the DVB-H standard. Analysts say that TV services will also need to meet the expectations of the digital TV generation, which expects high-quality images at low prices. Gartner stated that people are also likely to be deterred from watching TV on such small screens. Digital video recorders, such as Europe's Sky+ box, and video-on-demand services mean people have more control over the TV they watch. Broadcasting straight to mobiles may, as a result, be seen as removing that control. Smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900, and the Orange E200, which offer web access, text and multimedia messaging, email, calendar, and gaming, are becoming increasingly common.

Earl North Hollow intervenes on behalf of his son, resulting in Young's demotion and dishonorable dismissal instead. After the reprieve, Earl North Hollow becomes ill, and Young becomes the new Earl of North Hollow as the Star Kingdom declares war. Seeking revenge on Honor, Young first tries to ruin her reputation, then enlists Denver Summervale to duel Honor's lover, Paul Tankersley. Summervale kills Paul while Honor is on Grayson overseeing her lands and being made a Steadholder. Devastated by Paul's death, Honor resolves to kill Summervale at any cost. Honor's allies locate Summervale and coerce him into admitting he was paid to kill Paul, which renders his confession unusable in court. Honor provokes Summervale into challenging her to a duel and kills him in the duel that follows. Honor announces to the press that Pavel Young hired Summervale to kill Paul Tankersley and her. To avoid a challenge, Young hides, waiting for his ship to be repaired and Honor to be reassigned. Against orders, Honor manipulates parliamentary procedures to publicly accuse Young and demand a duel. Young accepts to avoid losing prestige and influence. During the duel, Young shoots Honor in the back, but Honor kills him before anyone can intervene. The nobility then expels Honor from the House of Lords and the navy places her on inactive status. Honor resolves to return to Grayson.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

After almost drowning and recovering from a fever, Darsie awoke imprisoned, visited by his captor and taken to Squire Foxley, who declined to intervene in Mr. Herries' guardianship.

{"id": 6140, "text": "Deep learning using convolutional networks has significantly improved medical image processing. A frequent obstacle is the limited availability of tagged medical images, as labeling them is costly and lengthy. This paper introduces a new approach to semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The network is improved using a mix of supervised loss (for labeled inputs) and regularization loss (for labeled and unlabeled data). To use unlabeled data, the method promotes consistent predictions from the network during training, even with differing regularizations for the same input. The method enhances regularization for pixel-level predictions through a transformation-consistent scheme in the self-ensembling model. The transformation includes rotations and flips. The proposed semi-supervised method was tested extensively on three medical image segmentation tasks. These tasks include skin lesion segmentation, optic disc segmentation, and liver segmentation. The datasets used include ISIC 2017, REFUGE, and LiTS. The proposed method outperformed current techniques in segmentation performance on 2D and 3D medical images, showing its effectiveness for medical image segmentation.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6151, "text": "Oil prices decreased significantly for the second consecutive day, reaching their lowest point in three months due to positive news regarding US crude reserves ahead of the winter season. London Brent crude closed at $40.15, a 5.1% decrease, after dropping below $40 per barrel for the first time since mid-September, while US light crude in New York decreased by more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest closing price since September 10. Both benchmark crudes have decreased in price by 12% over two days due to the Energy Information Administration's report on Wednesday stating that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than the previous year, alleviating concerns about potential winter shortages. The previous low levels of US fuel and heating oil reserves had been a persistent factor in increasing oil prices. An analyst commented on the swift change in market sentiment, which was also attributed to mild early-winter weather conditions, reducing the demand for heating oil. Stronger fuel inventories helped the US stock markets reach nine-month highs on Wednesday, but only the Nasdaq index maintained those gains by the end of Thursday's trading. The FTSE 100 index in London closed 15 points higher at 4,751, as the drop in oil prices helped alleviate investor concerns about the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. Traders cautioned that this decrease could be temporary if North America experiences a cold snap this winter or if significant supply issues arise elsewhere globally. Although crude prices are still approximately 30% higher than at the beginning of 2004, they have decreased from the record high of $55.67 set in late October. OPEC nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand, which has helped replenish US stocks affected by supply disruptions following Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments made on Wednesday by Algeria's energy minister, who indicated that OPEC would likely maintain its current output levels when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe that the steep decrease in crude prices could strengthen OPEC's stance on over-production, leading to a reduction in oil output. Concerns persist regarding the levels of US heating oil reserves, which are increasing but remain below 2004 levels. A cold snap in North America could deplete supplies and trigger further price increases. Analysts suggest that prices will decrease further if inventories continue to rise. One analyst stated that weather conditions will be crucial in the coming weeks, suggesting that prices could eventually fall to $30-35, but not immediately, given the remaining duration of the winter season. Another analyst noted that the EIA data suggested there should be sufficient supplies for the next three months in the US.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The book highlights the relatable and deceptive nature of these excuses, which prevent them from embracing true reality and joy. The narrator meets George MacDonald, his mentor, akin to Dante's encounter with Virgil, who guides him. MacDonald explains that souls can choose to remain in heaven, transforming past sorrows into joy and earthly experiences into extensions of heaven. Conversely, those who remain in the grey town experience a deterioration of their earthly happiness, turning it into hell. The ghosts fail to recognize that the grey town is actually hell, similar to their joyless, friendless, and uncomfortable lives on earth, but eternal and worsening, with some fearing the coming \"night.\" MacDonald states that leaving hell requires repentance and embracing joy.

The PC version of Call of Duty was more detailed, making this adaptation feel less polished.

Drawing from autoregressive generative models that use masked convolutions to predict pixels based on preceding pixels in a raster-scan order, the approach employs various masked convolution orderings to generate different perspectives of the data. The model creates two predictions from an input using two valid orderings and then learns by maximizing the mutual information between these two outputs. The outputs can be either low-dimensional features for representation learning or clusters corresponding to semantic labels for clustering. Masked convolutions are used in training, but standard convolutions are used during inference, giving the model access to the entire input.

Pixel-level tasks use CNNs to predict center pixel classes based on surrounding image sections and to adjust network settings. Standard forward and backward propagation, made for entire images, is slow for pixel-level work due to patch overlap causing repeated calculations.\n\nOur methods remove redundant convolution and pooling calculations using special sparse kernels while achieving identical results to patch-by-patch scanning. These kernel operations allow continuous memory access and efficient GPU use. A mask applied to the final layer's error map allows selection of specific patches for backward propagation, maintaining constant computational complexity regardless of the number of sampled patches. Testing reveals our algorithms are over 1500 times faster than common patch-by-patch scanning in both propagation directions, with larger images and patches showing increased speedups.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This paper introduces Rotation Equivariant Vector Field Networks (RotEqNet), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) design that incorporates rotation equivariance, invariance, and covariance. Convolutional filters are applied at various angles, producing a vector field that shows the strength and angle of the best orientation at each location. A modified convolution method is created using this vector field to make deep architectures. RotEqNet is evaluated on tasks that need different reactions to input rotations: image classification, medical image segmentation, orientation finding, and patch matching. The results demonstrate that RotEqNet creates very small models in terms of the number of parameters, while still performing as well as much larger networks.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 6184, "text": "Image segmentation is a crucial image processing task that involves categorizing pixels into groups based on intensity levels and a threshold. Segmentation quality relies on the threshold selection method. Standard multilevel thresholding methods require significant computation due to their exhaustive search for optimal values. Consequently, evolutionary optimization approaches have become more prevalent. The Electromagnetism Like algorithm (EMO) is an evolutionary technique inspired by the attraction and repulsion of charges within a population. EMO offers notable search capabilities with a low computational burden, unlike other algorithms. This paper presents an EMO-based multilevel thresholding (MT) algorithm, combining EMO's search strengths with objective functions from Otsu and Kapur's MT methods. The algorithm samples randomly from the image histogram, forming EMO particles that are evaluated using the Otsu or Kapur objective function. These candidate solutions evolve through EMO operators, guided by objective values, until an optimal solution emerges. The result is a multilevel segmentation algorithm that efficiently identifies digital image threshold values with fewer iterations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EMO for digital image segmentation.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Frankenheimer withdrew in 2002, one month prior to his passing. Skarsgard then assumed Neeson's role as Father Merrin, previously played by Max Von Sydow in the 1973 film. Filming took place in Morocco and Rome, costing approximately $32 million. In August 2003, it was revealed that Morgan Creek, the producers, were halting Schrader's film because it wasn't considered frightening enough. Besides replacing Schrader with Harlin, the producers also replaced most of the actors, though Skarsgard remained as Merrin. Harlin's film, released in the UK in October 2004, garnered moderate reviews but grossed over $76 million globally. The festival screening marks the initial public viewing of Schrader's film.

The Innocence Project and Williamson's attorney, Mark Barrett, exposed flaws in the prosecution's case, leading to a retrial ordered by Judge Frank H. Seay. Williamson and Fritz were exonerated by DNA evidence on April 15, 1999, after Williamson spent eleven years on death row. Williamson suffered psychological damage and was treated for mental illness. The State of Oklahoma, Ada, and Pontotoc County did not admit to any errors. Glen Gore was later convicted of the crime on June 24, 2003. He was given a life sentence in a second trial on June 21, 2006. Williamson and Fritz won a settlement for wrongful conviction in 2003 from the City of Ada and the State of Oklahoma. Williamson died on December 4, 2004, due to liver cirrhosis.

Arthur de Caldicot, a thirteen-year-old, is the second son of a knight residing in Caldicot manor, located in the March of Wales. The initial portion of the story focuses on difficulties present in medieval life. A central issue for Arthur is his status as a second son, preventing him from inheriting land. To establish his own life, he needs to become a squire, then a knight, and acquire his own manor and land. His deficiencies in physical skills such as jousting and swordsmanship pose a problem. His left-handedness, seen as a dangerous trait, forces him to fight with his weaker hand. Furthermore, his father considers making him a scribe due to his literacy. These issues resolve when, on his fourteenth birthday, he finds out that Sir William de Gortanore, his \"uncle,\" is actually his father, making him heir to a significant manor. However, his mother's husband was apparently killed by Sir William out of jealousy. Moreover, the revelation ends the engagement between Arthur and Grace, Sir William's daughter, because they are half-siblings. The story concludes with Arthur becoming a squire for Stephen de Holt, the Lord of the Middle Marches. Early in the story, Merlin provides Arthur de Caldicot with a \"Seeing Stone,\" cautioning that its power will be lost if its knowledge is shared. The stone allows Arthur to witness the life of King Arthur, starting with the marriage of King Uther and Ygerna. They have a son named Arthur, who Merlin places with a foster family. Years later, upon King Uther's death, Arthur becomes king. Many individuals bear resemblance to people in Arthur's real life. The most notable is the similarity between Arthur and the young King Arthur, leading de Caldicot to think that the Arthur he sees in the stone is a future version of himself. This idea is reinforced when he learns that his parents are, like King Arthur's, foster parents. Eventually, it becomes clear that King Arthur exists in a parallel world, where events mirror each other.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Franklin Raines, previously a high-ranking member of the Clinton administration and the company's chief executive, along with Tim Howard, the chief financial officer, are no longer with the organization. Regulators in the financial sector have found fault with Fannie Mae, potentially requiring them to revise previously reported profits by a figure as high as $9 billion. The company ranks as the second largest financial institution in the country. Recent inquiries have brought to light significant errors in the company's financial records. The firm plays a role in providing funds to the $8 trillion American mortgage market. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently rebuked the company, stating they had committed substantial errors in their financial reporting. The financial regulator stated that Fannie Mae would need to secure a large amount of new capital to repair its financial standing. Analysts have suggested that the SEC's criticism made it impossible for the top executives to continue in their roles. Mr. Raines, who formerly directed the Office of Management and Budget under President Clinton, has retired early, and Mr. Howard has also resigned, according to the company's announcement on Tuesday. Additionally, KPMG, Fannie Mae's independent auditing firm, will be replaced. Mr. Raines stated that he was holding himself accountable through his early retirement.\n\nFannie Mae was determined to have broken accounting rules related to derivatives and certain pre-paid loans. These financial instruments serve to protect against shifts in interest rates. Consequently, the company may be compelled to restate $9 billion in earnings from the past four years, essentially erasing one-third of the company's profits since 2001. While not directly providing loans to homebuyers, Fannie Mae stands as the most significant entity in the mortgage market, backing half of all home purchases in the United States. The company operates under a charter granted by the US Congress. It has faced considerable criticism from members of Congress, who convened hearings to investigate its finances earlier in the year, as well as from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), a government regulator. The director of OFHEO, Armando Falcon, expressed encouragement that the board's announcement indicated a shift towards a new culture and direction for Fannie Mae. The difficulties facing Fannie Mae represent the most recent problems to affect the American mortgage industry.

There may not be many bubbles but the mixture should swell a bit. Add two and one-half cups of the all-purpose flour, the water, and caraway seeds. Mix slowly at first, then at medium speed. Add one-half cup more of the all-purpose flour and the salt. The dough should combine and be tacky but not too sticky. Add more all-purpose flour, as needed, until the dough just pulls away from the bowl's sides. Continue mixing until the dough appears smooth, for about five minutes. Preheat the oven to three hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Turn off the oven three minutes after it reaches temperature. Spray the inside of a bowl with nonstick spray. Put the dough in the bowl and cover it tightly with plastic wrap. Put the bowl in the turned-off oven. Let the dough rise until it doubles, for about one hour. Once risen, take the bowl out of the oven. Preheat the oven to three hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Punch the dough and move it to a work surface. Use a bench knife to cut the dough into thirteen pieces, about three ounces each. Use both hands to roll the dough into uniform, tight balls, making sure there are no air pockets inside. Roll each ball into seven-inch cylinders using both hands, rolling from the middle out. Ensure the cylinders are the same length or the buns will be uneven. Keep any dough you aren't working with loosely covered in plastic. Line a sheet pan that is fifteen inches or longer with parchment paper or nonstick spray. Put each dough cylinder side by side in the middle of the sheet pan, leaving one-half inch between each. Cover the pan with plastic and let rise until the cylinders touch, about fifteen minutes. Take off the plastic wrap. Combine one tablespoon of water with the egg and brush this mixture evenly all over the dough. Let the dough rise for about fifteen minutes. Bake the dough until the tops of the buns are nicely golden brown and the centers are one hundred and ninety degrees Fahrenheit, rotating the pan halfway through, for about twenty minutes. Take the pan out of the oven and let the buns rest in the pan for ten to fifteen minutes. Transfer the buns in one piece to a cooling rack to prevent soggy bottoms and cool for about thirty minutes. Move the buns to a cutting surface. Slice down the center of each tube of dough using a serrated knife. You will lose half a tube on each end, resulting in twelve buns and two slices of rye bread to eat immediately. Where the tubes meet is the center of the bun. They should split naturally, but you can use a serrated knife to help if desired. Note: Placing tubes in a pan with higher sides and slicing between the natural separations works well. As long as the buns touched each other while baking, you should still get the \"bread wall effect\" and the buns will be more even. Now you have a bread wall that you can butter and toast. Wrap the buns in plastic or a re-sealable plastic bag until ready to use. Freeze the buns immediately if you won't use them the same day.

Ms. Brunini also mentioned that broadband internet will significantly impact the internet, similar to how color impacted television.\n\nHowever, searching has existed since the early days of the internet. Older search engines like Hotbot and Altavista are remembered by long-time internet users. Urs Holzle, Google's vice-president of operations, stated that search has always been important, especially now with more users and information, emphasizing its importance since 1999. He adds that people didn't initially understand search's potential, which is now apparent through its financial success. Google has successfully monetized web commerce with its targeted small advertisements, which appear alongside search results. These ads contributed to Google's $805.9 million revenue in a recent three-month period. Others have now realized the profitability of web queries. Holzle suggests that Microsoft's entry into the market validates the importance of search.\n\nMicrosoft is only one of the large internet companies now involved in search. Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, Amazon, and several smaller companies are all competing for user attention. As each company aims to surpass Google, web users have many choices through new search products like desktop search. This shift shows how the competition has moved from the internet to personal computers. Search is now more than just navigating the web; it involves accessing information within documents, images, and music stored on hard drives. Despite these advancements, search remains imperfect, often failing to deliver precise results. To improve, search engines are trying to understand users better by remembering, cataloging, and managing their information.

The exchange energy increases with the complete overlap of electron wave functions, leading to a bond between the electrons. This bond arises because singlet electrons can occupy the same spatial ground state simultaneously, lowering the energy compared to unpaired electrons; this is due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Paired electrons on the Fermi surface in momentum space can exist indefinitely. Electron movement within the crystal can hinder Cooper pair creation if kinetic energy exceeds binding energy. However, standing wave electrons, being local and having synchronous momenta, allow stable, weak singlet bonds despite high kinetic energy.

Producing thin film cameras (under 100 $\\mu$m) with integrated ASICs could be a preliminary step towards achieving multilayer 3D detectors and single-photon counting capabilities for use in XFELs.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Additionally, the previously suggested Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module is expanded to include image-level features that encode global context to improve performance.

{"id": 6233, "text": "Unpaired image translation concerns transforming an image from one domain to another without needing corresponding image pairs. Cycle-GAN and similar methods require this transformation to be reversible to ensure realistic outputs. This requirement works well for unimodal domains, but its effectiveness is uncertain in multi-modal situations like image segmentation because reversibility doesn't guarantee semantic accuracy. We introduce Sem-GAN, a GAN framework prioritizing semantic consistency, where semantics are determined by segment class identities from the source domain using a semantic segmentation algorithm. Our approach includes consistency constraints that, alongside GAN loss and cycle constraints, force translated images to adopt the target domain's appearance while roughly preserving source domain identities. We conduct experiments on various image translation tasks, showing Sem-GAN notably improves image quality, sometimes exceeding 20% on the FCN score. Furthermore, semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic images translated with Sem-GAN perform significantly better than those trained with other methods.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

What will result?\n\nWhat if Palomydes, too, rides, chasing the Questing Beast in solitude? Can he still envision Iseult, striving to be her best? Failure is nothing to him; he is steadfast.\n\nLove-sorrow is so dear to such a man that he will never be without it. He will idealize her. That knight is blessed.\n\nLikewise, can Launcelot not imagine Guenevere's embrace?

Honda, a Japanese car manufacturer, leads the way in creating robots with two legs, and the updated Asimo (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) is capable of running, navigating around obstructions, and interacting with people. Asimo may eventually be employed in domestic and professional settings. A Honda representative stated that the intention is to create a robot that can assist individuals in their everyday routines. Enabling the robot to run for the first time was difficult, requiring Asimo to execute a precise jump and absorb the landing's impact without losing balance. His current running pace is slower than that of Olympic athlete Kelly Holmes. It goes at roughly 3 km/h, which is similar to a relaxed jog. According to his creators, he is nearly four times faster than Sony's Qrio, which was the first robot to run last year. Engineers define running robots as those that have both feet off the ground between strides. Asimo's improvements include an increase in walking speed from 1.6km/h to 2.5km/h, a height increase of 10cm to 130cm, and a weight gain of 2kg. While yoga may be out of reach, he has more flexibility, allowing him to twist his hips and bend his wrists, thumbs, and neck. Asimo has had an impact on the international robot scene and was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame in November. His ability to walk upstairs, recognise faces, and respond to beckoning has wowed audiences worldwide. In August 2003, he even went to a state dinner in the Czech Republic with the Japanese prime minister as a goodwill ambassador. He is one of a few robots employed by technology firms to showcase their technological breakthroughs. Technology developed for Asimo could be used in the automotive sector, as electronics increasingly replace mechanics in car design. For the time being, Asimo's primary function is as an entertainer, and the audience that gathered to witness his first public run reportedly found his slightly humorous gait amusing.

{"id": 6255, "text": "The globe's biggest auto manufacturer, General Motors, has verified that it will be manufacturing a new Cadillac BLS of average size at its Saab factory in Sweden, which is not currently profitable.\n\nThis car, shown publicly at a motor show in Geneva, is meant to be a competitor in the mid-size luxury vehicle market. According to Carl-Peter Forster, the president of GM Europe, it will not be available for purchase in the United States. To entice European drivers, this vehicle will be the first Cadillac ever to run on diesel fuel.\n\nGM's announcement is likely to alleviate concerns about the Saab factory being shut down. The factory, located in Trollhaettan, has been the focus of conjecture regarding GM's intentions for severe cutbacks in its struggling European activities. However, the group's renewed dedication to the Swedish factory may not be well received by the group's Opel employees in Ruesselsheim, Germany, who may now have to deal with a greater share of GM's cost reductions.\n\nThe news is not entirely positive for Sweden either because it demonstrates Saab's inability to have a substantial impact on the lucrative European luxury vehicle market. Saab has consistently stated for many years that it is competing head-to-head with BMW, Mercedes, and Jaguar. Those leading companies in that sector disagree.\n\nGM's plans to manufacture the American brand in Sweden are part of its efforts to market it as a different kind of luxury brand to European drivers. It has been a well-known upscale brand in the United States for a long time, and even the presidential state car bears its name. However, it may be difficult for Cadillac to take market share from the major players in Europe. Other luxury automakers, most notably Toyota's Lexus subsidiary, have had considerable success in the United States without making substantial advances in Europe, where the German brands Mercedes Benz and BMW have maintained their dominance in the luxury market.\n\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden ought to assist in introducing much-needed scale to the Saab factory, which presently produces fewer than 130,000 vehicles annually. That is around half of what major automobile manufacturers believe to be sufficient for profitable operations, and Saab is quickly losing money, with losses reduced by half in 2004 to $200 million from $500 million the previous year. GM is cutting costs by building Saabs, Opels (branded as Vauxhalls in the UK), and now Cadillacs on the same platform, and by allowing the various brands to share parts, in addition to the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations. Shifting some of Saab's production to the United States, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European vehicle, could be another strategy to reduce Saab's losses. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is raising the cost of Saabs for US consumers. However, not everyone in the industry concurs that this would be the best course of action. The CEO of a prominent European automaker told BBC News that they are aware that in five years, the US dollar will be stronger than it is today and that the current trend toward US production was not intelligent.\n\nIn a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to give European consumers the opportunity to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models.

Spatial pyramid pooling networks use filters or pooling at different rates and viewpoints to encode multi-scale context. Encode-decoder networks recover spatial data to capture more defined object edges. This research merges the strengths of both approaches. The suggested model, DeepLabv3+, expands on DeepLabv3 by incorporating a basic but powerful decoder to improve segmentation, focusing on object boundaries. The Xception model is further examined, and depthwise separable convolution is implemented in both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder elements. This results in a quicker, more robust encoder-decoder network. The suggested model's efficacy is shown on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving test set results of 89.0\\% and 82.1\\% without post-processing.

{"id": 6257, "text": "Deep learning has greatly improved fundus image segmentation when training and testing data are similar. Medical images often vary, affecting how well these networks perform on new data. To address this, a new Domain-oriented Feature Embedding framework improves how well convolutional neural networks generalize to new data by using information from multiple data sources. This framework enhances image features with domain knowledge learned from multiple sources, making features more distinct. A Domain Knowledge Pool learns information from multiple sources. Original image features are then expanded using domain-specific aggregated features from the knowledge pool, based on how similar the input image is to images from other sources. A domain code prediction branch infers this similarity, and an attention mechanism dynamically combines the aggregated features with the semantic features. The framework was evaluated on two fundus image segmentation tasks, including optic cup and disc segmentation and vessel segmentation. This framework produces good segmentation results on new datasets and outperforms other domain generalization and network regularization methods.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Bob Strauss of the LA Daily News feels that there are too many televised events where stars praise each other and described them distastefully but said it amounted to a \"celebrity love-in\". His sentiment mirrored Chris Rock's, who stirred controversy by stating that he rarely watched the award shows and called them \"idiotic,\" adding that they are about celebrity and fashion. The recent Grammy Awards had poor ratings, and Oscars organizers are trying to avoid a similar outcome.\n\nChanges to the ceremony, such as lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner, have been announced. This has led to speculation that the changes are intended to increase advertising revenue. Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly claimed that the Oscars only generate significant excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster film is nominated. He also stated that the constant stream of film awards from various guilds means that there are few surprises left by the time the Oscars arrive. There is a lack of speculation about who will win, as shown by a review of the Los Angeles Times and Los Angeles Daily News.\n\nThe Times published a photo of tents being set up to protect the red carpet from rain. Publications like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter have remained focused on industry news, while in the UK, betting on the best actor category has closed, with Jamie Foxx expected to win.\n\nMike Goodridge of Screen International believes that the films of 2004 did not capture the public's imagination because filmmakers did not make films that people loved, like Saving Private Ryan. He also stated that 2004's films could be a response to 9/11, with audiences not necessarily wanting to see darker films like Million Dollar Baby, Aviator, and Finding Neverland, which have sad endings. The critics were not optimistic about Rock's ability to improve the awards show.\n\nStrauss doubted Rock's impact but supported lower ratings, stating that there are more important things than the Oscars. Karger believed Rock might attract younger viewers, while Goodridge thought his humor could alienate conservative states. Despite these opinions, the critics had views on who would win.\n\nKarger believed that Million Dollar Baby would win because it affected people emotionally, while Aviator focused on technical artistry. Strauss agreed that Eastwood would win, as Oscar voters often vote with their hearts. Goodridge thought that the best film and director awards would be between Aviator and Million Dollar Baby. Karger, whose favorite film of the year was Vera Drake, remained hopeful about the awards and stated that it is still one of the biggest TV events of the year.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6269, "text": "The story unfolds in Indiana, largely around the Limberlost swamp and the nearby made-up town of Onabasha. It's a coming-of-age story following a familiar pattern: a girl meets a boy, loses him, and then goes on a quest to win him back. Elnora Comstock, the main character, is a poor young woman living with her widowed mother, Katharine Comstock, near the Limberlost. Elnora experiences neglect from her mother, who is still grieving the death of her husband, Robert Comstock, who drowned in the swamp. Katharine holds Elnora responsible for his death, as he died while she was giving birth and couldn't save him. The Comstocks earn a living by selling farm products, but Mrs. Comstock refuses to exploit the forest or drill for oil, unlike their neighbors, even though it would improve their financial situation. Elnora is starting high school, where her simple clothes make it hard for her to fit in. She is determined to get an education, which her mother dismisses as pointless; Mrs. Comstock wants Elnora to stay home and work on the farm. The lack of money for tuition and books almost prevents her from continuing her education. Her solace comes from her academic abilities, especially in math and science; the kindness of her neighbors, Wesley and Margaret Sinton; a specimens box left to her by Freckles in the swamp; and her successful efforts to collect and sell items and moths from the Limberlost, which she stores in Freckles's box secretly from her mother. Elnora is intelligent, witty, and loves nature; she desires to be loved in return. She quickly makes friends at school. Eventually, Elnora earns her mother's love, but only after some difficult events. First, after doing well in high school, she wants to play the violin, like her father did. Margaret Sinton manages to get her the same violin Robert Comstock used to play, and Elnora becomes skilled at it. She knows her mother hates the violin, but she doesn't know why, so she must keep her playing a secret. Second, when Elnora is in her final year of high school, Wesley and Margaret insist that Katharine come with them to the school play. Katharine is not interested in seeing \"what idiotic thing a pack of school children were doing.\" But Katharine is curious about the high school; she enters it to mock it, then realizes she likes it; when she hears a violin, she enters the school play and sees Elnora playing \"as only a peculiar chain of circumstances puts it in the power of a very few to play.\" Seeing Elnora playing her dead husband's violin to an appreciative audience, and realizing her world has irrevocably changed - \"The swamp had sent back the soul of her loved dead and put it into the body of the daughter she resented, and it was almost more than she could endure and live\" - Katharine faints. Third, a few days later, Elnora thinks her mother understands that she needs to graduate so she can go to college or teach, both of which she would love to do. She tells Katharine that she needs new dresses for Commencement and trusts her to provide them. Mrs. Comstock, always rudely honest, gives her an old dress. Elnora sees this as a major betrayal, showing her mother's lack of love and consideration for her. That night, Elnora must find a good dress elsewhere. Fourth, Elnora has always hidden the fact that she earns money by selling moths from her mother. As she finishes her final year of high school and hopes to go to college, she realizes that there is one particular moth she must collect, which will pay her way to the future. In the novel's key conflict, Elnora sees her mother destroy that moth. When she objects, Mrs. Comstock slaps her. Elnora, who has always been patient, screams that she hates her mother and runs out. Mrs. Comstock, finally understanding how important Elnora is to her stable home life, sets out that night to replace the moth. She makes things worse, a fact which Elnora keeps from her, but when the Sintons discover that Mrs. Comstock hit Elnora, Margaret decides to intervene. She tells Katharine that she has been mourning for a husband who was unfaithful and planning to cheat on her. With this news, Katharine understands how she has neglected her loving, talented daughter. Elnora graduates and is now 19 years old. A young man, Philip Ammon, arrives in town. His uncle, a doctor, has sent Philip to Onabasha to recover from typhoid fever. He stays with Elnora and her mother for the summer and helps Elnora collect moths. The two slowly fall in love; however, he is already engaged to another young woman, Edith Carr, who is wealthy, spoiled, and self-centered. Elnora, to pretend that she is not beginning to fall for Philip, helps him write letters to Edith Carr and encourages his marriage to his childhood friend in every way. When Philip, after daily, prolonged conversation and fieldwork, discovers his romantic interest in Elnora is growing, Mrs. Comstock is the first to notice, but he assures her, \"I admire her as I admire any perfect creation.\" Mrs. Comstock replies, \"And nothing in all this world spoils the average girl so quickly and so surely.\" Philip Ammon is forced to return to Chicago when his father becomes ill, and he asks Elnora for a farewell kiss; she refuses him and returns to her mother, broken-hearted. Philip and Edith have an argument at what was supposed to be their engagement party. Edith insults him terribly and calls their engagement off (not for the first time). She has heard Philip talk about a wonderful young lady he met in the Limberlost. Philip leaves home and proposes to Elnora. On the very afternoon that he gives Elnora an engagement ring, Edith drives up, with some friends, to the Comstocks' home, in an unasked-for visit. When Edith demands to speak to Elnora privately and swears that Elnora will never take Philip from her, Elnora is cool and polite. When Edith's group leaves, Elnora secretly leaves, giving Edith the chance to prove that Philip would marry no one else. Philip becomes ill with worry about Elnora, and Edith's friend Hart persuades her to admit that she is wrong and that Philip will marry no one except Elnora. In the conclusion, it is suggested that Edith will marry Hart, just as Philip will marry Elnora.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6282, "text": "Two-dimensional nanomaterials, specifically transition metal sulfide semiconductors, have attracted considerable attention because they may be useful in creating photonic and optoelectronic tools like saturable absorbers and optical switches. This study showed that a tungsten disulfide saturable absorber can be used in very fast photonic applications. Tungsten disulfide nanosheets were created using liquid-phase exfoliation and then placed in a polyvinyl alcohol thin film so they could be used. Saturable absorption happened in the tungsten disulfide-polyvinyl alcohol saturable absorber near 1550 nm, which is in the telecommunications waveband. By putting the tungsten disulfide-polyvinyl alcohol saturable absorber into a fiber laser cavity, stable mode locking and Q-switching were both accomplished. The laser achieved femtosecond output pulse width and high spectral purity in the radio frequency spectrum during mode locking. During Q-switching, the laser's repetition rate and output pulse energy of a few tens of nano joules could be changed. These findings show that tungsten disulfide nanosheets within a polyvinyl alcohol thin film could be good nonlinear optical materials for very fast photonic applications as a mode locker or Q-switcher.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6286, "text": "The upcoming year seems promising for technology enthusiasts. Development in the hi-tech sector is expected to continue at a rapid rate, with significant competition, particularly in the mobile phone market, indicating a potentially excellent year. Third-generation mobile phones are predicted to become ubiquitous. Following previous launches, additional launches from other mobile phone companies are anticipated. These launches may result in competitive offers for consumers as companies attempt to attract new customers and encourage existing users to upgrade. The enhanced capacity of 3G networks allows one company to offer appealing rates for voice calls, which other companies will likely have to match. However, technological shifts and low voice call costs may lead to reduced revenue for operators. Operators will likely promote other features of 3G phones, such as video messaging and multimedia capabilities. Camera phones may rival digital cameras and gain popularity as higher-resolution devices become available. Emerging technologies, such as Wimax, may compete with 3G. Wimax could potentially offer high data transmission speeds and operate over long distances. A specific area is planned for the UK's first Wimax network, potentially providing high-speed internet access to rural areas. Analysts suggest Wimax may capture market share from 3G and prove advantageous. The return on investment offered by technologies like Wimax might affect the potential returns of 3G networks. The widespread availability of wi-fi should also be considered. The technology is increasingly common, but its expansion is limited by price variations across countries and suppliers.\nIncreased emphasis on integrating mobile and fixed phones is also expected. A project involving a hybrid device that utilizes mobile networks while away from home but switches to a fixed line when at home is set to be rolled out. Fixed-line phones will face greater competition from a technology that routes calls via the internet instead of the fixed-line phone network. Those with a broadband connection can potentially reduce their phone bills by using this technology. A specific area code has been designated for calls made with this technology, and increased consumer-focused call services using it are anticipated. Home broadband speeds will likely increase as competition is fueled by a decrease in new users. Portable media players are expected to gain prominence. A company has announced a collaboration to produce a phone compatible with a music service, and hybrid gadgets with large memory capacities and diverse functions will become more common. Advancements in storage media will continue to drive down the cost per megabyte of memory. Some devices will feature large hard drives, allowing users to store vast amounts of data. Convergence may lead to a decline in single-function devices. Instead, gadgets may be capable of performing a wide range of tasks and communicating in various ways. Consumers may face challenges in choosing from a wide selection of gadgets with numerous features and data storage capabilities.

{"id": 6291, "text": "Arthur Hailey, a novelist who passed away at 84, was famous for writing captivating and commercially successful books that delved into the intricate operations of different sectors, such as hospitality and finance.\n\nBorn in Luton, Bedfordshire, on April 5, 1920, Hailey was the only child of working-class parents who could not afford to keep him in school beyond 14 years of age. During World War II, he served as a Royal Air Force pilot, journeying to the Middle East in fighter planes. This occupation later inspired his debut work, the television screenplay *Flight into Danger*. In 1947, Hailey immigrated to Canada and became a citizen. Although he desired to be a writer from a young age, he did not pursue it professionally until his mid-thirties, after a flight to Toronto sparked the inspiration for his first screenplay.\n\nHailey later recalled that he began to visualize pilots at the controls and wonder about what would happen if they both got sick. He wondered if he, a rusty wartime pilot, who had not flown for nine years, could fly the airplane. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought *Flight into Danger* for $600 (\u00a3318) and broadcast it on TV in April 1956. It was later famously parodied in the 1980 comedy *Airplane!*, featuring Leslie Nielsen. Hailey worked as a screenwriter for several years before transitioning to writing novels. He went on to publish 11 best-selling books, translated into 38 languages in 40 countries. *Flight into Danger* was adapted into Hailey's first novel, *Runaway Zero-Eight*, in 1958. *The Final Diagnosis* and *In High Places* followed, also garnering popularity. However, it was *Hotel*, published in 1965, that drew the attention of Hollywood. The successful novel took four years to write and remained on national best-seller lists for a year. It was adapted into a film in 1967 and later into a soap opera in the 1980s, starring James Brolin. *Airport*, published in 1968, is arguably Hailey's most beloved work and initiated the disaster movie genre. The thriller follows events in the sky and on the ground at an airport dealing with a snowstorm, when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb.\n\nThe book was adapted into a popular film in 1970, featuring Burt Lancaster as the stressed airport manager and Dean Martin as a pilot, along with Jean Seberg and Jacqueline Bisset. Due to the popularity of the disaster genre, three sequels were produced. The writer was known for his meticulous research into the professions that his novels focused on, drawing his characters \"from real life\" and taking up to three years to write each book. He once said that he had never been able to write quickly or easily and that he was too self-critical and never satisfied. In 1969, he moved to Nassau in the Bahamas with his wife, Sheila. *Wheels*, *The Moneychangers*, and *Overload* followed. Despite receiving a mixed response from critics and few literary awards, Hailey was at the peak of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of Hollywood producers. *Strong Medicine*, Hailey's blockbuster about the pharmaceutical industry, was adapted into a film in 1986, starring Sam Neill, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and several former soap stars. The 1997 novel *Detective* was Hailey's last book, as he retired at the age of 77. Hailey's health had declined in recent years, and he underwent heart surgery twice. He suffered a stroke two months prior to his death. He died in his sleep on Wednesday, after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in New Providence Island. His wife, Sheila, said that he had a wonderful life and that his greatest ambition was to see his name on a book, which he certainly achieved.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6302, "text": "Sophisticated neural networks have become the best performing methods for segmenting images semantically. A major hurdle is that they require a large amount of precisely labeled images, which are difficult and costly to produce. The internet has a vast number of images, but they are only labeled in a general way. A key question is how to leverage these abundant but less specific labels for tasks requiring detailed labeling. Previous methods often used things like attention maps, object proposals, or bounding boxes. This paper introduces a model that creates supporting labels for each image and simultaneously makes the CNN's output adhere to mean-field restrictions imposed by a conditional random field. The approach ensures that each pixel's distribution resembles that of its neighbors to satisfy the CRF constraints. This differs significantly from methods that repeatedly expand the mean-field distribution using a recurrent structure and then train the resulting distribution. Instead, this model adds an additional loss component to the CNN's output, making it quicker than methods that use recurrent architectures. The method achieves top performance in weakly supervised semantic image segmentation on the VOC 2012 dataset, without using manually labeled pixel-level data. Also, adding conditional random fields to the CNN adds very little training time.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Drawing from image matting techniques, we present medical matting, a soft segmentation approach for handling and showing uncertain medical regions. Since medical matting datasets are scarce, we labeled two with alpha mattes. Because typical matting methods don't work well in medicine, we designed a new framework that creates masks and alpha mattes together. We incorporated an uncertainty map to emphasize unclear areas in the mask results, improving matting. Our model performed much better than existing matting methods on our datasets, showing alpha mattes are more effective than simple masks for labeling.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6309, "text": "As the Hyperion pilgrims journeyed to the Time Tombs, they told stories which revealed their reasons for participating in the Shrike Cult pilgrimage. At the beginning of the narrative, the pilgrims waited while a sandstorm took place in the valley. Father Hoyt, seeking death to escape his cruciform's pain, went to the Jade Tomb and tried to end his life, but the Shrike killed him. Brawne Lamia, noticing Hoyt's disappearance, found him at the Tomb and encountered the Shrike, firing at it with no effect before it vanished. Kassad quietly watched, hoping to draw Moneta and the Shrike out to confront them. The remaining pilgrims asked the Consul to bring his ship to the valley for medical supplies for Rachel Weintraub, who was dying. The Consul reluctantly agreed, but the ship was interdicted by Gladstone and Hyperion authorities. Following this, Lamia and Silenus were sent to Keep Chronos and the Poets' City for food. Silenus went to the Poets' City to complete his \"Hyperion Cantos\", but was surprised by the Shrike and impaled on the Tree of Thorns. Lamia got the needed supplies at Keep Chronos and returned to the Valley, but the Shrike attacked her, and she lost consciousness. She awoke at the edge of the TechnoCore in a computerized reality, accompanied by the John Keats persona from her implant. Ummon, an AI, revealed several TechnoCore motivations before killing the persona, and Lamia lost consciousness again. Father Paul Dur\u00e9 was resurrected from Hoyt's body and briefed by the Consul on the journey. He chose to wait with Sol Weintraub and Lamia while the Consul used his hawking mat to reach Keats and try to use his connections to free his ship. The Consul crashed miles from Keats and was captured by thieves, escaping due to Theo Lane, who returned with him to the capital. At the Tombs, True Voice of the Tree Het Masteen reappeared and revealed Shrike Cult and Templar Brotherhood collusion before dying. Dur\u00e9 left Sol, supposedly for a \"walk\", and vanished. Moments before Rachel's birth and the Time Tombs \"opening\", Sol took baby Rachel to the Sphinx Tomb, where the Shrike took her inside. Severn's character, the second John Keats \"cybrid,\" appeared at a Government House event on Tau Ceti Center, where he claimed to be an artist providing an artistic view of the war for Hyperion, which the Ousters were attacking. At the event, Hegemony officials watched a FORCE fleet leave for Hyperion, after which Severn accepted an invitation to dinner from Lady Diana Philomel. After the dinner, Severn was seized by Philomel, her husband, and associates, who tried to get classified information from him, but they were interrupted by Hegemony security who arrested his captors. Severn then watched Hegemony cabinet and Gladstone's inner circle meetings, updating Gladstone on the pilgrims while pretending to be an artist. Suddenly, between meetings, Gladstone learned that the Ousters had counterattacked the WorldWeb, an unexpected move. FORCE strategic reserves were committed to Hyperion, so the first worlds threatened by the Ouster invasion seemed doomed. Severn toured several of the worlds, narrowly escaping a mob that recognized him as one of Gladstone's associates. As Shrike Cult uprisings devastated Hegemony planets, Keats traveled to Pacem and met Father Dur\u00e9, who had disappeared from Hyperion after entering the planet's underground labyrinth and had been escorted by the Shrike to Pacem, where he spoke with Monsignor Edouard about his past experiences. Dur\u00e9, intrigued by the collusion between the Templar Brotherhood and the Shrike Cult, went to God's Grove, which was soon to be within range of the Ouster invasion armada. Severn, accompanied by Leigh Hunt, farcast to Tau Ceti Center but arrived on an analog of 19th century Earth, specifically Rome, where the historical Keats died. Like the original Keats, Severn contracted tuberculosis and died physically, but his persona retreated into the TechnoCore's computerized realities. The Consul met with the Ouster Swarm leaders attacking Hyperion, which was about to fall. He was tried for the murder of Ouster agents he had killed previously, but he was sentenced only to live during the coming turbulent times. The Consul then learned that there was no Ouster offensive against the WorldWeb, and he concluded that the TechnoCore was the only power capable of such an attack. The Ousters offered the Hegemony support in their struggle against the TechnoCore, but only in retaliation for the Hegemony's fall, which they claimed was inevitable since the Ousters refused to use farcasters. Gladstone, who had decided to use a TechnoCore device against the Ousters while Hegemony citizens evacuated and retreated into the labyrinths, received this information and discovered that FORCE autopsies of Ouster bodies revealed that the \"Ousters\" were actually TechnoCore \"cybrids.\" Gladstone retired briefly and was approached by Severn in a dream. Having met with Ummon, his creator, Severn had learned that the TechnoCore resided within the farcaster system, fearing alien intelligences (Lions and Tigers and Bears) to be found in the Void Which Binds. Gladstone ordered the destruction of the farcaster network, knowing that it would cause death and chaos, but also stop TechnoCore activity. She did so and resigned as chief executive. Back on Hyperion, Brawne Lamia, having awakened from her coma, entered the Shrike Palace to find Silenus and the Shrike's other victims connected via a long cable. She freed Silenus as the Shrike appeared to attack her. She froze the Shrike, and it fell over a precipice and shattered. Meanwhile, Sol's daughter Rachel appeared outside the Time Tombs as a young woman, carrying her younger self (now aging normally again). Giving her younger form to Sol, she explained that she was Moneta and was now traveling back in time with the Shrike under orders from humanity's future. She disappeared, and Sol decided to go forward in time to Rachel's future using the portal. FORCE elements discovered that the TechnoCore invasion had suddenly stopped, and that the invasion armada lacked any personnel. Throughout the former WorldWeb, chaos broke out, with shocked Hegemony citizens becoming violent. On Tau Ceti Center, Government House was besieged by a furious assembly of citizens. Gladstone allowed herself to be killed by the demonstrators, remaining on the planet even after her de jure successor, Senator Gabriel Kolchev, fled. The story concluded several months later; the worst of the chaos had subsided, and Hyperion was flourishing again, with former Hegemony citizens and Ousters co-existing. New glyphs gave some insight to the Time Tombs, and the portal to the future rarely admitted a person. The novel ended with the Consul returning to the former Web Worlds in his starship to discover what happened, with Severn's AI stored in his ship.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Currently, this initial resolution is often chosen without specific reasoning. Research indicates varying segmentation accuracy and speed based on initial resolution, even for similar images. A method to automatically choose the best resolution would be helpful. This paper presents a framework for automatically choosing the optimal segmentation resolution. We suggest a way to determine the best resolution based on user/system needs, balancing speed and accuracy. A learning method is then used to select resolution, linking image features to the pre-identified best resolution.

{"id": 6327, "text": "Electron microscope efficiency has grown substantially, facilitating in-depth examination of cell shape and structure. Mapping neural networks at the level of individual connections is a primary goal, but cell and developmental biology are also benefiting. The resulting data volume makes manual identification of individual objects infeasible, a task essential for many analysis procedures. Although automated identification methods have progressed using convolutional neural networks, they are still less accurate than human labeling and need further manual correction. A key limitation is the restricted view of these networks, preventing the incorporation of cell shape or other biological knowledge that humans use for identification. This work demonstrates how such information can be utilized by representing it as distant relationships within a graph partitioning problem called the lifted multicut problem. Using this method, the accuracy of identification is significantly improved for three complex electron microscopy segmentation challenges in neuroscience and cell biology.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Instead of a single neural network trained on all data, we train multiple networks on data subsets reflecting distinct segmentation styles. As segmentation styles and their relation to observers may be unknown, subgroups are automatically identified. A genetic algorithm identifies the optimal data segmentation. This allows each network to learn a specific segmentation style from grouped training data. We demonstrate this using open-source prostate MRI segmentation data with artificial observer variations.

The votes in question were later included in the count for the local elections that took place that month in England. The three individuals, who had been elected to represent the Aston area, maintain their innocence regarding accusations of unlawfully obtaining votes. The presiding judge has stated that the entire system of voting by mail is being carefully examined. Judge Richard Mawrey, QC, speaking at the hearing held at the Birmingham and Midlands Institute, conveyed to those present that the situation had the possibility of creating substantial ramifications for any upcoming general election.\n\nThis special tribunal, the first of its kind in recent memory to address accusations of manipulation in elections, began its work in Birmingham the previous month. The accusations against Muhammad Afzal, Mohammed Islam, and Mohammed Kazi were initiated by supporters of the Liberal Democrat party from the local area. Their argument is that the three men benefited from the widespread misuse of mail-in votes during the election that took place on June 10th. Ravi Sukul, representing those bringing the case, stated that the three individuals were \"heavily involved\" in illicit activities. The court was told that witnesses reported seeing them carrying numerous bags from their campaign headquarters, which the men transported in a vehicle to a storage facility situated in an industrial park off Birch Road East.\n\nLaw enforcement was notified and dispatched to the specified location. Mr. Sukul recounted that upon arriving at the scene, officers encountered a sizable room containing a table approximately ten feet in length and six individuals of Asian descent. The table was covered with a large number of documents and unsealed envelopes. The police officers left the warehouse, but were subsequently instructed to return and confiscate the documents. Mr. Sukul stated that the envelopes and papers had been scattered when the officers first arrived.\n\nHe continued by saying that when they returned to collect the items, the 275 ballots had been neatly placed in an envelope and sealed. Mr. Mawrey interrupted Mr. Sukul, stating that it sounded as if these men were running an illegal voting operation in an industrial area. The court was told that the police took the documents to the elections office the following morning, where they were mixed with other ballots. The case against the men is a continuation of a hearing regarding claims of postal fraud made against three other Birmingham council members in the Bordesley Green area, allegations that are being contested. Mr. Mawrey is expected to provide a judgment in their case after the Aston case has been reviewed. Mr. Afzal, Mr. Islam, and Mr. Kazi deny being part of a scheme to commit election fraud in order to deceive the returning officer.

{"id": 6350, "text": "Ray Charles posthumously received Grammy Awards and influenced the development of rock and pop as a pioneering artist. His diverse sound, which included blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, and country, significantly impacted the UK beat and R&B scenes. Some compared his importance to Elvis Presley, and his songs influenced artists such as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon, and Van Morrison, as well as later artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recorded a duet. While James Brown was considered the godfather of soul, Ray Charles was regarded as a founding father, combining gospel music with R&B along with Sam Cooke to create soul music.\n\nWithout Charles, the Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, and Wilson Pickett would be different. He was also a composer, arranger, and band leader who performed at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall, and recorded with Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. He also struggled with heroin addiction, which led to his arrest in 1965. His successful Atlantic R&B songs from the 1950s were covered by rock 'n' roll artists and included \"I've Got A Woman\" (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and \"Hallelujah, I Love Her So\" (Eddie Cochran). After the song \"What'd I Say,\" he pursued a more pop-oriented sound, recording \"Georgia On My Mind\" and \"Hit The Road Jack.\"\n\nHe received recognition in country music with covers of Hank Williams songs, and his 1962 album \"Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\" remains a classic. His version of Don Gibson's \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" was a number one hit in both the pop and R&B charts. In 1972, he expressed his views on poverty and civil rights in his album \"A Message from the People,\" similar to work of Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, and Marvin Gaye. In 1993, he incorporated hip-hop beats into his album \"My World,\" although he stated he didn't know what hip-hop was at the time. When Charles died at age 73 in June 2004, Quincy Jones called him a \"brother,\" stating that no other musician had broken down musical genre walls as much as Charles. Paul Jones said that Charles influenced his writing, and that Charles' music would have a lasting impact.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Sky also imposes a \u00a310 monthly fee for the service, unless customers subscribe to their higher-tiered bundles. Telewest has not yet disclosed the price for the new device or whether a service fee will be implemented.\n\nEric Tveter, president and COO of Telewest Broadband, stated their PVR set-top box would be available later in the year, eliminating missed shows, disrupted movies, and conflicts regarding recording choices. PVRs and recordable DVDs will likely supplant VCRs as the standard for recording and keeping preferred shows. Last year, Dixons stated they would cease selling VCRs, opting for PVRs and recordable DVDs.

{"id": 6353, "text": "Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate various new surface manufacturing techniques using ion beam sputtering, specifically those utilizing dual beams, sequential beam applications from different angles, or rotating samples. Only erosion-dominant scenarios were considered. The findings were compared to existing theories and experimental data. Oppositely aligned dual ion beams generate stable, symmetrical ripples. Right-angled crossing beams form square patterns only when perfectly balanced; otherwise, they produce ripple patterns with orientations predictable by linear continuum theory. Sequential ion beam sputtering rapidly destroys structures from the previous beam direction after rotation, temporarily reducing overall roughness. Superimposing patterns from multiple rotations is challenging due to their brief existence. For a single beam on a rotating sample, roughness exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with rotation frequency, with a distinct minimum occurring at a frequency determined by the relaxation of prestructures observed in sequential beam setups. Additionally, the logarithm of structure height decreases proportionally to the inverse frequency.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 6354, "text": "Vignal and Novo scored, giving Rangers a victory over Celtic at Celtic Park, putting Rangers ahead of their rivals by three points. Rangers had trouble creating opportunities until Douglas, Celtic's goalie, allowed Vignal's long shot to slip through his hands and into the net. Conversely, Waterreus, the Rangers goalie, made excellent saves against Bellamy and Hartson. Novo then clinched the win, chipping the ball over Douglas with eight minutes remaining. This result ended Celtic's eleven-game home winning streak in Old Firm derbies and gave Alex McLeish, Rangers' manager, his first win at Celtic's home ground. Celtic had previously won their last six home games against Rangers, including two earlier that season. Celtic began the game confidently, with Bellamy, recently acquired on loan from Newcastle United, debuting alongside Hartson and Sutton, who was positioned in midfield. Bellamy quickly threatened, challenging Andrews before firing a low shot that Waterreus stopped on the second attempt. Bellamy had a better opportunity after Hartson won the ball from Kyrgiakos and put his teammate through on goal. However, Waterreus made a good save, stopping Bellamy's weak shot from 16 yards. Waterreus again came to the rescue when Hartson received the ball inside the box, and the Dutch goalie made a brave block. Ferguson returned for Rangers, and McLeish used the same lineup that had scored four goals against Hibernian. However, Rangers had a harder time breaking down Celtic's defense, and Douglas was not seriously tested until ten minutes into the second half. Prso turned past Lennon, but Douglas pushed away his powerful shot from 18 yards. Andrews made a great defensive header, preventing Hartson from scoring from close range. Hartson outmaneuvered Vignal near the Rangers box, but Waterreus once again saved the striker's shot. Rangers began to control the midfield, and Vignal, after receiving a pass from Ricksen, scored the first goal when Douglas mishandled the Frenchman's shot. Novo then took advantage of a moment of hesitation in Celtic's defense, running onto a long ball from Ricksen and lobbing it over Douglas. Ricksen was apparently struck by a coin, but this did not stop Rangers' celebrations at the final whistle. The Celtic lineup was: Douglas, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Laursen, Petrov, Lennon, Sutton, Thompson, Bellamy, and Hartson. The substitutes were: Marshall, Henchoz, Juninho Paulista, Lambert, Maloney, Wallace, and McGeady.

{"id": 6358, "text": "A warning has been issued by a trade body regarding a system designed to simplify website address creation using alphabets like Cyrillic, suggesting it could be exploited by scammers. The Internationalised Domain Names system, recently approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force after years of development, raises concerns for the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) about the potential for increased fake site creation by scammers, stemming from the computer codes utilized to represent language. According to UKIF's director, Stephen Dyer, registering look-alike domain names of legitimate companies to redirect users to fake sites for password and credit card theft could become easier. Domain names, functioning as \"real language\" website addresses, rely on ASCII codes for European languages and Unicode for others; this could lead to websites like PayPal being coded with a mix of Latin and Russian alphabets, appearing identical to users but leading to a fake site due to differing computer codes. An already registered fake Paypal.com domain through Verisign by an individual following the IDN debate serves as a precedent, raising concerns despite being handed back to Paypal. Mr. Dyer emphasizes the commercial world's unawareness of the ease with which websites can be faked, urging users to be alert to a new, almost undetectable method of diversion to seemingly genuine sites. Potential solutions include browsers highlighting mixed-character domains as warnings, although updating all browsers would be a significant undertaking, and introducing IDN-disabled browsers, which could be an overreaction. The Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, CENTR, agrees, cautioning against rushing to introduce IDN-disabled browsers, arguing that it would harm public confidence in IDNs, a technology crucial for the non-English speaking world.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

But progress is slow, the Soviet Union and Western countries are both involved, and pressure within the country is rising. The ANC isn't disarming properly or stopping terrorist plots, and white moderates are against total \"one man, one vote\" system. To make things worse, South African commandos find out that ANC fighters are plotting to kill the government. Karl Vorster, an Afrikaner Resistance Movement fanatic and Minister for Internal Security, wants to use this to his advantage and lets the plan continue, even though he knows about it. The regime's hardliners want the ANC terrorists to kill their political rivals so they can take power. After most of the moderate cabinet dies, Vorster becomes president and declares martial law. Security forces start brutally cracking down on anti-apartheid groups, and people suspected of ANC ties are killed or put in camps. Suppression, torture, and state killings become common. The South African Defence Force is ordered to invade newly independent South West Africa (Namibia) to bring back apartheid, but Cuban military personnel push south from Angola to support their Namibian allies, stopping Vorster\u2019s invasion. As the invasion stalls, things at home get worse. Police kill hundreds of white students protesting conscription at the University of the Witwatersrand, and some Afrikaners start secessionist movements in the Transvaal and Orange Free State. The regime also faces tribal revolts after a Zulu chieftain is denaturalised. Attempts to suppress dissent with brute force lead to greater unrest, like an uprising by Durban\u2019s Indian population. The Cuban leadership, with help from African states like Libya and Mozambique and support from Moscow, invades South Africa. Cuban tanks rapidly approach Pretoria, brushing aside the feeble resistance offered by reservists and Afrikaner militias. Karl Vorster orders the use of nuclear weapons in a desperate attempt to save the city, using one to strafe an armoured column, eliminating three thousand Cuban and Libyan soldiers. The radiation contaminates much of the Transvaal, affecting everyone. Cuba retaliates with chemical weapons against SADF positions, but the ANC deserts their communist allies because of the hundreds of innocent deaths. Havana then uses live civilians as human shields, intending to reduce the threat posed by South Africa\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Anti-Vorster factions seize Cape Town, destroying the country's economy. When the price of precious metals increases, hurting the global economy, the U.S. and Great Britain intervene militarily. Despite heavy losses, a joint American and British task force, with air and naval support, overruns the government's nuclear weapons. With this threat gone, rebel-backed Rangers capture Vorster and his supporters. American air strikes force the Cuban Army to withdraw, and the Soviet Union vows to stop spending money on the continent. The illegal government falls, but ANC units and Afrikaner secessionists remain hostile. Apartheid is abolished, and various political parties work to establish a new, multiracial South Africa.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The study uses the industrial sector classification of stocks as a standard to assess how well each method recovers this classification. Findings indicate that the Directed Bubble Hierarchical Tree is superior, extracting more information with fewer clusters. The research further demonstrates that economic information is concealed at different levels within the hierarchical structures, depending on the clustering method. A dynamic analysis using a rolling window shows that different methods react differently to events influencing financial markets, such as crises. These findings could be valuable for applying clustering methods to portfolio optimization and risk management.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Howard alluded to disagreements between Blair and Brown hindering crime reduction efforts, which was used for Conservative campaign ads. Blair downplayed the reported divisions, highlighting Labour's economic achievements as the important issue for voters. Brown was promoting anti-poverty initiatives in Africa and affirmed his trust in Blair, despite allegations of discord detailed in a new book, Robert Peston's Brown's Britain. Peston's book alleges significant animosity between Blair and Brown. It also claims Blair had intended to resign before changing his mind due to support from allies and suspicion regarding Brown's actions. Peston claimed Brown told Blair that he could no longer believe anything Blair said; Blair denied this quote. Blair did not confirm or deny that he had offered to step down. Howard insisted agreements had been reached with the chancellor during dinners. He asked how schools could have discipline when the government lacked it, and questioned the ability to fix hospitals amid governmental disarray. Blair avoided addressing \"tittle tattle in books\" and pledged to promote Labour's economic, healthcare, and law and order accomplishments. Liam Fox stated the Conservatives would emphasize the \"juvenile\" behavior of the prime minister and chancellor. Labour demonstrated unity at their own poster launch, featuring Brown alongside Alan Milburn, whom Blair appointed to lead election planning, replacing Brown. Charles Kennedy stated the government was divided and that cosmetic exercises would not convince anyone. Blair was expected to discuss the direction of his party's upcoming election manifesto later in the week. Blair and Brown encountered discontent from their party at a meeting due to the claims within Peston's book.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6375, "text": "Ilan Papp\u00e9 asserts that around 800,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced in 1948, a figure representing over half the Palestinian population at the time, and that 531 villages were destroyed, along with 11 urban Palestinian neighborhoods. Palestinians call this event the Nakba, or the catastrophe. Papp\u00e9 argues that the Nakba was a deliberately planned act of ethnic cleansing by Zionist Israelis. He insists that this view is unambiguous, citing Zionist writings, military and political documents, and David Ben-Gurion's diaries. He also aims to understand why the denial of the Nakba has been so successful. This viewpoint is contrary to the mainstream Israeli narrative, which claims the relocation was voluntary. Ilan Papp\u00e9 believes acknowledging the past is crucial for a better future. He claims that the idea of ethnic cleansing appeared early in Zionist writings, citing Leo Motzkin's statement in 1917 about Jewish settlement and Arab resettlement, and David Ben-Gurion's 1938 support for compulsory transfer. He also indicates that this was implemented in 1948 by David Ben-Gurion, Yigael Yadin, Moshe Dayan, Yigal Allon, Yitzhak Sadeh, Moshe Kalman, Moshe Camel, Yitzak Rabin, Shimon Avidan, Rehavam Zeevi, Yitzhak Pundak, and others. Ben-Gurion's advisors, referred to as the 'Consultancy group', were the ideological drivers, while officers leading attacks by the Haganah, Irgun, Stern Gang, and Israeli Defense Force were the implementers. The \"ethnic cleansing strategy\" is detailed in Plan Dalet, an Israeli military/government document, which Papp\u00e9 says contained clear directives for the operation. These directives included 'bombarding villages\u2026setting fire to homes, properties and goods, expulsion, demolition and planting mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled inhabitants from returning.' Papp\u00e9 discusses the definition of ethnic cleansing based on ethics, international law, and agreements, referring to sources such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the United States Department of State, and the International Criminal Court. He also mentions the U.S.'s brief support for Palestinian return through United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194. According to Papp\u00e9, the expelled are removed from official history and collective memory. He concludes that the erasure of this alleged ethnic cleansing from conventional Israeli history has been successful. Papp\u00e9 asserts that the creation of an exclusively Jewish Israeli state was a key element of Zionism. He also states that, prior to the British Mandate, Palestine had been under Muslim control for 1300 years. Zionism grew in the 1880s, particularly through Theodore Herzl's writings, and gained momentum by the time Britain controlled Palestine after World War I. After the Balfour Declaration on October 31, 1917, Yosef Weitz began a detailed demographic study of Palestinian villages called the Village Files, which was later used for strategic information in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. He discusses the British military operations that suppressed Palestinian uprisings in 1929 and 1937, with the 1937 uprising significantly weakening the Palestinians' ability to fight for their homeland. The Haganah and the Irgun also received key training from Britain. Ben-Gurion stated, 'The Arabs will have to go.' Ben-Gurion's state-building strategy included Plans A, B, C, and D, which involved specific military actions intended to deter Palestinian attacks on Jewish settlements and retaliate against assaults on Jewish properties. Plan C outlined punitive measures such as killing Palestinian leaders, inciters, financial supporters, officers, and officials, as well as damaging Palestinian transportation, livelihoods, and attacking nearby villages and meeting places. Plan Dalet called for the total expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland. In 1947, Papp\u00e9 recalls, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine proposed the creation of two states and the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 181. He also recalls that this was immediately rejected by the Palestinians. David Ben-Gurion's advisors, that Papp\u00e9 calls the Consultancy, began its planning to deal with the Palestinian resistance. Plan D (Plan Dalet) was adopted on March 10, 1948. It called for, amongst many things, the initial uprooting of 250,000 Palestinians. The Jordanian promise to not join any all-Arab military operations against the Jewish state followed key negotiations between Israel and Jordan. The British departed Palestine on 15 May 1948. Haganah had 50,000 trained troops. The implementation of Plan Dalet continued in earnest. The Deir Yassin massacre occurred. In it, 93 Palestinians were killed. Soon after, four more villages were taken. They were Qalunya, Saris, Beit Surik, and Biddu. The United States offered a scheme to stop the bloodshed by first establishing a three-month cease-fire and then developing a trusteeship plan in five years. Both ideas were rejected by the Israelis. Ben-Gurion had stated \"Only a state with at least 80% Jews is a viable and stable state\" and that Palestinians 'can either be mass arrested or expelled; it is better to expel them.' Papp\u00e9 states that many Palestinian villages such as Dayr Ayyub, Beit Affa, and Khisas had virtually no defense mechanism of any kind. The attack on Balad al-Shaykh occurred leaving 60 Palestinians dead. The Hawassa neighborhood in Haifa was evacuated. The Sarraya house in Jaffa was bombed leaving 26 dead and the Samiramis Hotel in Qatamon was bombed leaving many others dead. Papp\u00e9 refers to Yosef Weitz again, a member of the Consultancy. Weitz had stated, 'The only solution is to transfer the Arabs from here to neighboring countries. Not a single village or a single tribe must be left off.' Papp\u00e9 describes various cities, and villages, and the operations to cleanse them. Operation Naschon was the first operation of Plan Dalet. It specifically called for the destruction of Palestinian villages in April 1948. It was the first time that the various Israeli militias would operate together as a unit and become the Israeli Defense Force. Papp\u00e9 states 'the Arab governments did little beyond airing their inflammatory war rhetoric in all directions so as to hide their inaction and unwillingness to intervene on behalf of the Palestinians.' The United Nations plan had allocated Haifa, the only port of the country, to be granted Jewish control. Mordechai Maklef as the operation officer of the Carmeli Brigade, issued orders to 'Kill any Arab you encounter; torch all inflammable objects and force doors open with explosives'. Crowds of defenseless Palestinians ran down the streets of Haifa to the port to escape on any boat they could find. 'Many [boats] turned over and sank with all their passengers'. The next cities to fall were Acre, Nazareth and Safad. Papp\u00e9 states that the Arab Liberation Army was never a match against the well organized Israeli forces. According to Papp\u00e9, there was never serious Arab Liberation Army strength, so 'the falsity of the myth of a Jewish David facing an Arab Goliath' was very clear. As Jerusalem was cleansed, 'British inaction was the rule.' In April 1948 the cleansing of Jerusalem began. 'All in all, eight Palestinian and thirty nine villages were ethnically cleansed in the Greater Jerusalem area.' After the battle was won by the Israeli Haganah, 50,000 Palestinians were forced to leave Jaffa. By 15 May 1948 200 Palestinian villages were occupied and their people expelled. This chapter discuses the dual nature of the 1948 conflict particularly during May 1948. On one hand there was the Arab Israeli war and on the other hand there was the ethnic cleansing. In a letter that David Ben-Gurion sent to the commanders of the Haganah brigades he stated, 'the cleansing of Palestine remained the prime objective of Plan Dalet.' Papp\u00e9 states that the Arab war efforts were 'ineffective', and 'pathetic'. The most intensive Arab efforts occurred in the first three weeks of the war. Ethnic cleansing was conducted in at least 64 villages by the Israeli Alexandria brigade according to Papp\u00e9 They were also part of the massacre at Tantura, per Ilan Papp\u00e9, on May 2, 1948. He quotes from various witnesses that as many as 230 were massacred there. Various other brigades such as the Golani Brigade, Carmeli Brigade, Kiryati Brigade, Harel Brigade, Bulgarian Brigade, Yiftach Brigade, and Givati Brigade also conducted cleansing operations. Papp\u00e9, in this chapter, discusses June through September 1948. The ethnic cleansing continued despite the passage of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights through the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 217A(III) David Ben-Gurion's diary June 5, 1948 states, 'the cleansing operation continues.' Eliezer Kaplan, the minister of finance authorized the confiscation of all Palestinian properties already taken. Papp\u00e9 states that numerous Palestinian villages had been peacefully occupied by Muslim, Druze, and Christians for centuries. On July 18, 1948 another truce was organized by the U.N. mediator Count Folke Bernadotte. Papp\u00e9 states, 'In less than two weeks, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been expelled from their villages, towns, and cities.' Papp\u00e9 begins this chapter with quotes from the Badil Resource Center. 'In 1948, 85% of the Palestinians living in the areas that became the state of Israel became refugees.' 'It is estimated that there were more than 7 million Palestinian displaced persons at the beginning of 2003.' He talks about Operation Hiram, War Crimes During the Operation, Mopping Up Operations, Israel's Anti-Reparation Policy, Final Cleansing of the South and the East, and The Massacre in Dawaymeh. Papp\u00e9 states 'I have no illusion that it will take more than this book to reverse a reality that demonizes a people who have been colonized, expelled, and occupied, and glorifies the very people who colonized, expelled and occupied them.' Papp\u00e9 starts this chapter with another set of quotes about ethnic cleansing, including, 'Since 1967, Israel has detained 670,000 Palestinians.' Sections of this chapter are entitled Inhuman Imprisonment, Abuses Under Occupation, Ghettoizing the Palestinians of Haifa, Rape, Dividing the Spoils, Desecration of Holy Sites, Entrenching the Occupation, and The Land Robbery: 1950\u20132000. This chapter, like others, starts with provocative quotes. 'Over 700,000 olive and orange trees have been destroyed by the Israelis. This is an act of sheer vandalism from a state that claims to practice conservation of the environment.' The sections of this chapter include; The Reinvention of Palestine, Virtual Colonialism and the J.N.F., The J.N.F. Parks In Israel, The Forest of Birya, The Ramat Menahse Park, and Greening of Jerusalem. Papp\u00e9 states that 'the Israeli Land Authority, the army, the government and the Jewish National Fund' have all been 'involved in establishing new Jewish settlements on the lands of the destroyed Palestinian villages.' He goes on to state, 'The true mission of the J.N.F., in other words, has been to conceal these visible remnants of Palestine not only by the trees it has planted over them, but also by the narratives it has created to deny their existence.' As an example, Papp\u00e9 refers to the Forest of Birya, which is the largest man made forest in Israel. It conceals the land of six Palestinian villages; Dishon, Alma,Israel, Qaddita, Amqa, Ayn al-Zaytun, and Biryya. Also the Ramat Menashe Park covers the ruins of Lajjun, Mansi, Kafrayan, Al-Butaymat, Hubeza, Daliyat al-Rawha, Sabbarin, Burayka, Al-Sindiyana, and Umm al-Zinat. The Jerusalem forest is another example. Here Papp\u00e9 states that the creation of the United Nations Relief and Work Agency was not committed to the return of the refugees as resolution 194 was. There were one million Palestinian refugees and U.N.R.W.A. was created to meet their daily needs as refugees. He states that international peace brokers consistently sidelined the Palestinian cause and there 'was the categorical refusal of the Israelis to acknowledge the Nakba and their absolute unwillingness to be held accountable, legally, and morally, for the ethnic cleansing they committed in 1948.' For the following two decades there was a lull in international interest. Then, 'The June War (1967) ended with total Israeli control over all of ex-Mandatory Palestine.' As a response, for four decades, Yassar Arafat conducted a campaign to get the world to recognize that an ethnic cleansing had occurred in 1948. And according to Papp\u00e9, this task for the Palestinians continues to today. Papp\u00e9 mentions that the Knesset had even gone to the extent of passing a law that prohibited Israeli negotiators from discussing the right of return. He also speculates that if Israelis were to acknowledge the Nakba that it would be akin to recognizing 'that they have become the mirror image of their own worst nightmare.' This chapter is about various measures Israel has taken to protect itself. As an example, Papp\u00e9 starts this chapter by describing a law the Knesset passed on 31 July 2003. This law states that any Palestinian who marries an Israeli will not be granted Israeli citizenship, permanent residency, or temporary residency. He also discusses the advent of the Israeli West Bank barrier. He states, 'None of this is new.' because Theodore Herzl wrote in 1895, 'We shall endeavor to expel the poor population across the border unnoticed, procuring employment for it in the transit countries, but denying it any employment in our own country.' In 2003 Benyamin Netanyahu said, 'If the Arabs in Israel form 40% of the population, this is the end of the Jewish State. But 20% is also a problem. If the relationship with these 20% becomes problematic, the state is entitled to employ extreme measures.' Here, Papp\u00e9 states that the Faculty Club of Tel Aviv University is called the Green House. It is built upon the remains of the Palestinian village, Shaykh Muwannis. It is the epitome of the denial of ethnic cleansing according to Papp\u00e9 because there is no mention of its true history. Papp\u00e9 goes on to say, furthermore, that the university does not have a record of looking into the Zionist history of ethnic cleansing whatsoever in any of its disciplines. He concludes by saying 'We end this book as we began: with the bewilderment that this crime was so utterly forgotten and erased from our minds and memories. But we now know the price: the ideology that enabled the depopulation of half of Palestine's native people in 1948 is still alive and continues to drive inexorable, sometimes indiscernible, cleansing of those Palestinians who live there today.'\nAccording to Ilan Papp\u00e9, around 800,000 Palestinians were made to leave their homes in 1948, representing over half of the Palestinian population at the time. Also, 531 villages and 11 Palestinian urban neighborhoods were destroyed. Palestinians refer to this event as the Nakba, or the catastrophe. Papp\u00e9's argument is that the Nakba was a calculated act of ethnic cleansing by Zionist Israelis. He insists this is certain, using Zionist writings, military and political documents, and David Ben-Gurion's diaries as evidence. He also wants to understand why the denial of the Nakba has lasted so long. His perspective differs from the mainstream Israeli view, which claims the relocation was voluntary. Ilan Papp\u00e9 believes that understanding the past is necessary for a better future. The idea of ethnic cleansing, he states, appeared in early Zionist writings. He cites Leo Motzkin's 1917 statement about Jewish settlement and Arab resettlement, and David Ben-Gurion's 1938 support for compulsory transfer. He also states that David Ben-Gurion, Yigael Yadin, Moshe Dayan, Yigal Allon, Yitzhak Sadeh, Moshe Kalman, Moshe Camel, Yitzak Rabin, Shimon Avidan, Rehavam Zeevi, Yitzhak Pundak, and others implemented the plans in 1948. He identifies Ben-Gurion's advisors, the 'Consultancy group,' as the ideological drivers, and officers from the Haganah, Irgun, Stern Gang, and Israeli Defense Force as the implementers.

Here, Papp\u00e9 states that the Faculty Club of Tel Aviv University is called the Green House. It is built upon the remains of the Palestinian village, Shaykh Muwannis. It is the epitome of the denial of ethnic cleansing according to Papp\u00e9 because there is no mention of its true history. Papp\u00e9 goes on to say, furthermore, that the university does not have a record of looking into the Zionist history of ethnic cleansing whatsoever in any of its disciplines. He concludes by saying 'We end this book as we began: with the bewilderment that this crime was so utterly forgotten and erased from our minds and memories. But we now know the price: the ideology that enabled the depopulation of half of Palestine's native people in 1948 is still alive and continues to drive inexorable, sometimes indiscernible, cleansing of those Palestinians who live there today.'\nIlan Papp\u00e9 contends that nearly 800,000 Palestinians were forcefully removed from their homes in 1948, which was more than half the entire population. Also, 531 villages were destroyed and 11 Palestinian urban neighborhoods were emptied. Palestinians refer to this event as the Nakba, meaning catastrophe. Papp\u00e9's thesis is that the Nakba was a planned and deliberately executed ethnic cleansing by Zionist Israelis. He emphasizes that this is an undeniable fact and includes references to Zionist quotes and writings, military and political archives, and the diaries of David Ben-Gurion. He also intends to explore how the denial of the Nakba has been so effective. His views are in direct opposition to mainstream Israeli perspectives of the relocation, which claim it was 'voluntary'. In his preface, Ilan Papp\u00e9 states that addressing the past is the only way to improve the future. Papp\u00e9 asserts that the idea of ethnic cleansing was expressed in early Zionist writings. As an example, in 1917, Leo Motzkin said, 'the colonization of Palestine has to go in two directions, Jewish settlement\u2026and the resettlement of the Arabs.' In 1938, David Ben-Gurion stated, 'I am for compulsory transfer; I do not see anything immoral in it.' Then in 1948, according to Ilan Papp\u00e9, the ethnic cleansing was implemented by David Ben-Gurion, Yigael Yadin, Moshe Dayan, Yigal Allon, Yitzhak Sadeh, Moshe Kalman, Moshe Camel, Yitzak Rabin, Shimon Avidan, Rehavam Zeevi, Yitzhak Pundak, and others. The ideological forces behind the campaign were Ben-Gurion's advisors, who Papp\u00e9 calls the 'Consultancy group'. The officers who led attacks executed by the Haganah, the Irgun, the Stern Gang, and the Israeli Defense Force were the implementers. The \"ethnic cleansing strategy\" is described in Plan Dalet, an Israeli military/government document. According to Papp\u00e9, Plan Dalet outlines the clear directives of the operation in writing, including 'bombarding villages\u2026setting fire to homes, properties and goods, expulsion, demolition and planting mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled inhabitants from returning.' This chapter focuses on the definition of ethnic cleansing in terms of ethics and international law and international agreements. Papp\u00e9 refers to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the United States Department of State, and the International Criminal Court for sources of discussion. He also discusses the U.S.'s short-lived support for the Palestinians by endorsing United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194, which calls for the return of the displaced Palestinian refugees. Papp\u00e9 states that 'Later on, the expelled are then erased from the country's official and popular history and excised from its collective memory.' He concludes that this alleged ethnic cleansing has been successfully erased from conventional Israeli history. Papp\u00e9 states in this chapter that a key ingredient in the Zionist creation of an Israeli state was such that it would be created exclusively for Jews. Prior to the British Mandate, Palestine had been under Muslim control for 1300 years. Zionism emerged in the 1880s, largely through the writings of Theodore Herzl. The Zionist movement had been growing steadily by the time that Britain took control of Palestine after World War I. On October 31, 1917, the Balfour Declaration occurred. 'Lord Balfour gave the Zionist movement his promise\u2026to establish a national home for the Jews in Palestine.' In the 1920s, Palestinians made up 80\u201390 percent of the population of Palestine. As a result of the Balfour Declaration, Yosef Weitz began a detailed demographic study of the Palestinian villages called the Village Files. It was later used for key strategic information needed to implement the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. This chapter also includes a history of the impact of British military operations in suppressing the Palestinian uprisings in 1929 and 1937. The uprising in 1937 was significant in that the British thoroughly defeated the Palestinians, strategically impacting their ability to fight for their rights to their homeland. Britain provided key training for the Haganah and the Irgun. David Ben-Gurion stated, 'The Arabs will have to go.' Ben-Gurion's strategy for the creation of the Israeli State included offensive military steps, described in Plans A, B, C, and D. 'The purpose of such actions would be to deter the Palestinian population from attacking Jewish settlements, and to retaliate for assaults on Jewish houses, roads, and traffic. Plan C spelled out clearly what punitive actions would entail, such as * Killing the Palestinian leadership. * Killing Palestinian inciters and their financial supporters. * Killing Palestinians who acted against Jews. * Killing senior Palestinian officers and officials. * Damaging Palestinian transportation. * Damaging the sources of Palestinian livelihoods: water wells, mills etc. Attacking nearby Palestinian villages likely to assist in future attacks. * Attacking Palestinian clubs, coffeehouses, meeting places, etc.' Plan Dalet (Plan D) called for the systematic and total expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland. Here Papp\u00e9 recalls that in 1947 the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine called for the creation of two states and the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 181 stating so. The Palestinians immediately rejected this. Then David Ben-Gurion's group of close advisors, that Papp\u00e9 calls the Consultancy, began its planning to deal with the Palestinian resistance. Plan D (Plan Dalet) was adopted on March 10, 1948. It called for, amongst many things, the initial uprooting of 250,000 Palestinians. This initial uprooting represented the beginning of the actual execution of Plan Dalet. Key negotiations between Israel and Jordan had led to the Jordanian promise to not join any all-Arab military operations against the Jewish state. The agreement 'neutralized the strongest army in the Arab world.' The British departed Palestine on 15 May 1948. Haganah had 50,000 trained troops. The implementation of Plan Dalet continued in earnest. The Deir Yassin massacre occurred. In it, 93 Palestinians were killed. Soon after, four more villages were taken. They were Qalunya, Saris, Beit Surik, and Biddu. The United States offered a scheme to stop the bloodshed by first establishing a three-month cease-fire and then developing a trusteeship plan in five years. Both ideas were rejected by the Israelis. Ben-Gurion had stated \"Only a state with at least 80% Jews is a viable and stable state\" and that Palestinians 'can either be mass arrested or expelled; it is better to expel them.' Papp\u00e9 states that many Palestinian villages such as Dayr Ayyub, Beit Affa, and Khisas had virtually no defense mechanism of any kind. The attack on Balad al-Shaykh occurred leaving 60 Palestinians dead. The Hawassa neighborhood in Haifa was evacuated. The Sarraya house in Jaffa was bombed leaving 26 dead and the Samiramis Hotel in Qatamon was bombed leaving many others dead. Papp\u00e9 refers to Yosef Weitz again, a member of the Consultancy. Weitz had stated, 'The only solution is to transfer the Arabs from here to neighboring countries. Not a single village or a single tribe must be left off.' In this chapter, Papp\u00e9 describes various cities, and villages, and the operations to cleanse them. Operation Naschon was the first operation of Plan Dalet. It specifically called for the destruction of Palestinian villages in April 1948. It was the first time that the various Israeli militias would operate together as a unit and become the Israeli Defense Force. Papp\u00e9 states 'the Arab governments did little beyond airing their inflammatory war rhetoric in all directions so as to hide their inaction and unwillingness to intervene on behalf of the Palestinians.' The United Nations plan had allocated Haifa, the only port of the country, to be granted Jewish control. Mordechai Maklef as the operation officer of the Carmeli Brigade, issued orders to 'Kill any Arab you encounter; torch all inflammable objects and force doors open with explosives'. Crowds of defenseless Palestinians ran down the streets of Haifa to the port to escape on any boat they could find. 'Many [boats] turned over and sank with all their passengers'. The next cities to fall were Acre, Nazareth and Safad. Papp\u00e9 states that the Arab Liberation", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This contentious law has been stalled for a year. Certain large technology companies believe it is necessary for safeguarding innovations, while others worry about its negative impact on smaller technology companies. The European Commission states that the Council of Ministers will adopt the version that was agreed upon in May but said it would review all aspects of the directive. The goal of the directive is to provide patent protection for inventions that rely on software, or \"computer-implemented inventions.\" EC President Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso stated in a letter that the Commission would not submit a new proposal to Parliament and the Council of Ministers, as it supported the agreement reached in May 2004. Should the European Council approve the draft directive, it will go back to the European Parliament for a second reading. This does not guarantee the directive will become law and will likely result in additional delays and controversy. Most EU laws now require approval from both the Parliament and the Council of Ministers. A French MEP warned that ignoring the Parliament's request would be an insult, and the Parliament would then reject the Council's version during the final stage of the decision procedure. The United States allows for the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods. Amazon.com, for example, holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics worry that the directive could lead to a similar situation in Europe. There are fears this could negatively affect small software developers due to their lack of legal and financial resources to fight patent lawsuits.

The network's parameters are learned through end-to-end training to automatically learn deep features which help improve performance within a non-local patch-based label fusion framework. These learned deep features help define a similarity metric for atlas selection.

Each segmented region is shown as a vector indicating its membership levels to different thematic labels, and the entire image is shown as a Regions Partition Matrix. Segmentation happens on this matrix, not individual pixels, through two main parts: focusing and spreading. Focusing selects seed regions for information to spread from. The spreading part allows this information to extend to other regions, using fuzzy contextual data to provide the information needed for semantic segmentation.

The contrasting trends of rising unemployment and a record number of employed individuals can be attributed to a growth in the working population and a decrease in economic inactivity. The UK's unemployment rate increased from 4.6% to 4.7% compared to the previous quarter, but it remains low compared to Germany, Spain and France. Despite the rise in employment, the manufacturing sector experienced a loss of 104,000 jobs in the last quarter of 2004, bringing employment in that sector to a record low of 3.24 million at the year's end. Some analysts predict that the Bank of England will likely increase interest rates this year because of these figures.

Eagles rescued the infants and took them to a valley, where deer nursed them. The boys grew and formed a tribe, aided by continuous eagle deliveries.

{"id": 6428, "text": "This work presents two key advancements for conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to enhance the numerous applications that utilize this framework. The initial key advancement is an investigation of cGANs demonstrating that they are not inherently conditional. Specifically, it will be demonstrated that the discriminator, and consequently the cGAN, does not inherently acquire the conditional relationship between inputs. The second advancement is a new technique, named acontrario, that clearly models conditionality for both components of the adversarial framework through a new acontrario loss that involves training the discriminator to acquire unconditional (adverse) instances. This results in a new type of data augmentation strategy for GANs (acontrario learning) that allows limiting the generator's search space to conditional outputs through the use of adverse examples. Extensive experiments are conducted to assess the discriminator's conditionality by introducing a probability distribution analysis. Comparisons with the cGAN framework for various applications reveal considerable performance improvements on established datasets, encompassing semantic image synthesis, image segmentation, and monocular depth prediction, using various metrics, including Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Root Mean Square Error log (RMSE log), and Number of statistically-Different Bins (NDB).", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Other statistics indicated that spam accounted for 73% of all emails in 2004, and one in sixteen emails contained a virus.\nMessageLabs' year-end report identified phishing as the primary security threat and the most common attack method among cybercriminals. In September 2003, MessageLabs detected only 273 phishing emails attempting to lure users to fraudulent replicas of legitimate bank and financial institution websites. However, by September 2004, they were blocking over two million phishing emails monthly. The company expressed concern that phishing groups were employing increasingly advanced strategies to acquire valuable information, such as login credentials or personal data.\nWhile older attacks depended on users failing to recognize a fake website, newer phishing emails directly attempt to steal information upon opening. Other phishing schemes seek to enlist unwitting individuals as intermediaries for money laundering or handling goods purchased with stolen credit cards.

{"id": 6434, "text": "The initial installment of a series of three books recounts Fitz's beginnings as an illegitimate child (indicated by his given name, FitzChivalry, where Fitz signifies Bastard, and Chivalry alludes to his father, Chivalry, literally \"Bastard [of] Chivalry\"), in Buckkeep Castle, detailing his initiation into the world of assassination and his triumph in shielding the throne from his overly ambitious uncle, Regal, almost losing his life in the process. The narrative begins with Fitz being escorted by his maternal grandfather to Moonseye, the Farseer's army base, located on the border of the Mountain kingdom, and currently commanded by Prince Verity, the second son of King Shrewd. Upon arrival, a soldier is informed that Fitz is King-in-Waiting Chivalry's bastard son. The soldier then brings him to Prince Verity who orders that he be given into the care of Burrich, Chivalry's own stableman and man at arms. Fitz and Burrich travel to Buckkeep, the Farseers' stronghold. His arrival is preceded by his father's abdication from the post of King in Waiting; in order to protect Fitz by preventing association through contact and blood, Chivalry relinquishes his position and, with his wife, Lady Patience, withdraws to the royal estate of Withywoods prior to Fitz's coming. Fitz has no memory of meeting Chivalry, yet he forms a connection with Verity, his father's brother. Regal, Chivalry and Verity's younger half-brother, feels animosity toward Fitz and mistreats him whenever possible. Burrich, his father's trusted aide, is entrusted with the care and upbringing of the newly named Fitz-Chivalry, which he undertakes to the best of his ability, employing Fitz as a stable boy. Fitz quickly becomes proficient in his duties and spends about a year living with Burrich, tending to the animals in the stables. However, Fitz experiences loneliness and cultivates a close friendship with a young dog named Nosy. Fitz is in possession of \"The Wit,\" an ancient and widely distrusted form of magic that grants him telepathic communication with animals; he bonds with Nosy, and they become close companions. Burrich discovers Fitz's bond and, with apparent disapproval, takes Nosy away, severing their connection. Fitz assumes that Burrich has killed the dog, leading him to become more apprehensive of Burrich, suspecting that his life is as easily disposable to Burrich. Fitz finds companionship with children in Buckkeep town, particularly a girl named Molly, who is a year or two older than him. Fitz eventually becomes a \"King's Man\" to King Shrewd, pledging an oath to serve the king. He is brought into King Shrewd's service and moves into the castle itself. Here, he receives an education and is taught basic combat skills by Hod, the keep's weaponmaster. One night, he is introduced to a recluse named Chade, a skilled assassin. Fitz, feeling desperately lonely and lacking other prospects, agrees to learn Chade's skills. During his childhood, he is instructed in the ways of an assassin, demonstrating considerable aptitude in his assignments and successfully completing minor tasks for the king. Meanwhile, news arrives from Withywoods concerning Chivalry's death; although it is said that he fell from a horse, suspicion falls on Queen Desire, King Shrewd's second wife and Regal's mother, who is believed to have orchestrated his assassination. As Fitz grows up at Buckkeep, the coastal regions of the Six Duchies are under attack by Outislanders known as the Red-Ship Raiders. The Raiders pillage villages and towns, killing and abducting people while taking very little of value, making their attacks seem without clear motivation. The hostages are later returned in an animalistic condition, with little recollection of their past lives. When Fitz encounters these returned hostages, he discovers that he cannot sense them with his Wit at all. This dehumanization process is named after Forge, the first village to suffer such a raid. Subsequently, these Forged Ones become robbers and thieves, further burdening the Six Duchies. Fitz joins a class of students who are taught the Skill, a form of magic that allows users to share thoughts and strength. The instructor, Galen, harbors animosity towards Fitz, while curiously revering his father (later in the book, it is revealed that Chivalry imprinted a false loyalty on him, using the Skill, in a fit of rage). During the classes, Galen treats Fitz with disrespect, frequently referring to him as \"Bastard.\" He attempts to kill Fitz, and, failing that, tries to sabotage his Skill training. During the final test of Galen's Skill classes, Galen sends Fitz to Forge, ostensibly to determine if he can use the Skill to get back. The area is overrun with Forged Ones, and Fitz is attacked, but he manages to return safely. During his absence, a stable hand, in league with Galen, attempts to assassinate Burrich. In the midst of this, Smithy, the dog Lady Patience gave Fitz, with whom Fitz is Wit-bonded, is killed. Towards the end of the book Fitz is asked to go to the neighboring Mountain Kingdom with the objective of assassinating its prince, Rurisk. However, this mission is compromised when Regal reveals Fitz's secret mission to Rurisk's sister, Kettricken, while drunk, rendering him useless. He becomes embroiled in a scheme to seize the throne for Prince Regal with the help of Galen, who attempts to assassinate Verity using the Skill. Prince Rurisk is poisoned and killed, leaving Kettricken, who is betrothed to Verity, as the sole heir of the Mountain Kingdom. Fitz is poisoned and then submerged in a deep pool, a half-hearted attempt by Regal to kill him. As Fitz is on the verge of death, he manages to contact Verity using the Skill to help him destroy Galen. He is rescued by his dog Nosy, who was not killed by Burrich but sent to the Mountain Kingdom as a gift to Prince Rurisk. The rescue from the pool by Nosy left deep teeth marks in his hand that he comes to cherish as a sign of Nosy's love and loyalty. Nosy, being an old dog by this point, dies, leaving Fitz lamenting about how his true master, Rurisk, is dead, and how he \"gave his life freely, remembering that we were good to one another when we were puppies\" (in the words of Fitz). Fitz is healed by Jonqui, King Eyod's sister, afterward, and the closing pages of the book express Fitz's deep sorrow over Nosy's death during that event and the older narrator's pain at writing this.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

{"id": 6448, "text": "What she said that evening is irrelevant. The odd thing happened the following day. My mind was filled with music she had played. I couldn't recall it completely, but fragments of it circled among vague memories, searching for something, trying to communicate something, provoking unease and bordering on sadness. I tried to recreate the melody from memory, but it failed me. The chords and dissonances rose but found no resolution, only hung suspended and left me melancholic. Where had I heard this before? What hidden, forgotten place was it hinting at? It suggested 'dust, dust, and sunlight, a cold, clear evening in April, bedraggled, rain-soaked snow spotting the unpleasant grass, someone walking alone, and someone declaring that everything must end because it was time to leave.' These were the phrases, but beneath them, a larger shadow moved. Standing in this shadow, I speculated. Was it the blue-eyed woman who always danced in golden slippers? Had I danced with her to this music? Or did it come from further back, from the uncharted twilight of childhood? No, it was more recent than that. You know how sometimes a word or name escapes you, and you pursue it through fleeting shadows, lunging for it, lying in wait to seize it, setting subtle traps of sensation or sound, until suddenly, as in a dreamlike forest, you hear it, see it flash among the branches, and almost without knowing how, you possess it. It was in this way that I followed the music, catching glimpses of a face in darkness, hearing a cry, recalling forgotten days, exhausted moods, corners bathed in sunlight, puddles reflecting stars, until unexpectedly, the answer revealed itself. I remembered an April afternoon eight years ago, or perhaps nine\u2014it doesn't matter, let's say nine\u2014a room where the last of the sunlight was fading, a vase of violets, fragrance in white curtains, and she who would later play the same thing. She played this tune and abruptly stopped, letting her hands fall into her lap. She sat there for a moment with slumped shoulders, then picked up a rose, a large white rose fully opened like a lotus, pressed it to her cheek, and closed her eyes. 'You know, we have to end this. Miriam loves you. If she ever knew, or even suspected, what would she do? Listen, I'm not being absurd. I'm sure of it. If you had an eye for women, to understand them, which you never have, you'd know it too.' The conversation was half humorous, with underlying sadness, half serious, half lighthearted, while her fingers softly searched for this tune, played it, and let it fade, now note by note, now chord by chord, repeating phrases with a kind of pleasure. Was it symbolic of the woman's weakness that she could neither break off the melody nor finish it? It paused, wandered, paused again, while she, perplexed and tired, half suggested I should leave, half asked if I thought I ought to leave. Well, April passed with many other evenings, similar evenings with later and warmer sunlight, with violets always present, and fragrant curtains. And she was right, and Miriam found out. And after eight long years, or nine, we met again by chance, but I wonder if it was truly by chance that she played this tune. What, then, was the intention?", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The rotation invariance of the presented technique is a key advantage, enabling it to unwrap a broader range of images than existing methods.

The conformal method's creation of constant mean curvature (CMC) sections of Kasner spacetimes is detailed before focusing on non-CMC sections of the simplified flat Kasner spacetimes. Within this limited scope, a comprehensive account of constructing specific $U^{n-1}$ symmetric sections is achieved, even when far from CMC. It is discovered that many conformal data sets, when generating these sections, produce a single flat Kasner spacetime, though some far-from-CMC sets yield one-parameter families of sections. While these non-CMC families resemble known CMC one-parameter families, they have key differences. Notably, contrary to the CMC situation, the condition indicating these non-CMC families' presence is not readily apparent from the conformal data set.

The anatomical locations act as a supervisory signal and don't require additional manual annotation. This seemingly simple task provides a strong signal for feature learning, and self-supervised learning achieves high segmentation accuracy that is better than or comparable to a U-Net trained from scratch, especially with limited data.

The story begins with Kammerer's accidental discovery of Saraksh, an unexplored planet populated by humanoids. The planet's technological advancement mirrors mid-20th century Earth. Saraksh has recently endured a nuclear and conventional war, leaving its inhabitants in a difficult situation. When Kammerer's spaceship lands, the locals, mistaking it for a weapon, destroy it. Initially, Kammerer doesn't consider his predicament serious. He pictures himself as a Robinson Crusoe, marooned among primitive but friendly people. He anticipates making contact and forming bonds with the planet's inhabitants. However, the reality proves much less appealing. Kammerer finds himself in the capital of a totalitarian nation, constantly at war with neighboring countries. An oligarchy of Unknown Fathers governs the population through harsh police and military tactics. The city is bleak and contaminated. Ordinary citizens live in hardship and misery. The situation is perplexing to Kammerer, who comes from a society free of war, crime, and shortages. It is eventually revealed that mind control broadcasts are used by the Fathers to maintain control over the people. These broadcast towers are scattered throughout the country, disguised as missile defense systems. The towers' mind-altering effects suppress critical thinking, making the regime's propaganda more effective. Furthermore, twice daily, powerful broadcasts induce intense enthusiasm, relieving mental stress caused by the difference between propaganda and reality. The authors depict this process through the thoughts of a character transitioning from boredom and disdain to adoration of life and those around him. Some people are immune to the broadcasts, instead experiencing headaches and seizures. The ruling oligarchs, the Unknown Fathers, are among this group. They endure personal suffering during the broadcasts in exchange for their power to control the people. Those outside the elite who are unaffected by the broadcasts are labeled \"degens\" and are persecuted. They face execution or imprisonment when caught. These renegades form an underground resistance, aiming to destroy the broadcast towers. The resistance lacks a political or military agenda, united mainly by their suffering and hatred of the towers. However, most of the underground are unaware of the towers' true purpose, as the leadership seeks to control the broadcast network and seize power. Kammerer, still somewhat oblivious, joins the military and is ordered to execute captured \"degens,\" including a woman. Refusing, he is shot but survives. He then joins the underground and participates in a failed attack on a broadcast tower. He is captured, tried, and sent to a concentration camp in the South, where he initially landed, and learns the truth about the broadcast system from a fellow prisoner in the underground. Appalled by this revelation, Kammerer vows to eliminate the mind control broadcasts. Several plans fail, as the cure might be worse than the disease. He attempts to incite an invasion by desert barbarians and then tries to contact the Island Empire, a neighboring state. However, he abandons this plan after discovering documents detailing the Empire's atrocities. He then concentrates on locating and destroying the Control Center, the source of the mind control broadcasts. Kammerer is captured and assigned to a penal battalion tasked with invading the North. During this unsuccessful invasion, many of his friends die, and he narrowly escapes annihilation in retaliatory nuclear strikes. Kammerer is immune to the broadcasts. A Father named Smart realizes this and plans to use Kammerer to stage a coup. He intends for Kammerer to capture the Control Center and use the broadcasts to control the population. The Center is shielded by intense local broadcasts, making it accessible only to Kammerer. Initially, Kammerer complies, but upon entering the Center, he destroys it instead of seizing power. The novel concludes with the revelation that one of the Fathers, Strannik, is actually Rudolf Sikorski, a human progressor. Strannik had been carefully planning to improve the lives of the people of Saraksh gradually, but Kammerer's actions disrupted his plan. Strannik confronts Kammerer, criticizing his interference and explaining the unintended consequences: up to 20% of the population may die due to withdrawal from the mind control transmissions, and Saraksh faces famine, anarchy, and invasion from the North. Strannik orders Kammerer to leave, but he refuses, choosing to stay and help stabilize the situation.

The show's presenter, Jonathan Dimbleby, informed the audience that the MEP had been covered in farm waste from \"head to toe.\" Mr. Kilroy-Silk was able to appear on the show after receiving a borrowed change of clothes. He expressed his anger to reporters and said he planned to file charges if the attacker was apprehended. He recounted that the man shouted: \"You've offended my religion, I'm doing this in the name of Islam.\" Mr. Kilroy-Silk stated, \"As I started to turn around, a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car.\" He added, \"I was totally covered, it was all through my clothes, and it stank to high heaven.

This paper offers a cooperative way to train image segmentation models and a method to make hard examples using latent space increase. These help the model work better generally and be stronger with only a little data. The cooperative training has a fast-thinking network and a slow-thinking network. The fast-thinking network learns separate image and shape qualities for image rebuilding and segmentation. The slow-thinking network learns shape expectations to fix and improve segmentation. The two networks train together. The latent space increase makes difficult examples for training by hiding parts of the separated latent space in channels and areas. Many experiments were done on public heart image datasets. Using just 10 subjects from one place for training, it was shown that this improves how well the model segments images from different sites and makes it stronger against different surprise image problems when compared to good baseline methods.

{"id": 6517, "text": "Separating how structures change from how they originate or take shape creates numerous research possibilities, especially in chemistry. When atoms of a proper element combine under consistent conditions, their outer electrons move within specific boundaries. Atoms perform electron movements by reacting to forces linked to their initial growth locations. Upon briefly becoming neutral, an atom's outer electron moves due to unchanging forces. When that electron vanishes from conserved pole forces, it instantly returns to its original state. Thus, one electron movement cycle creates a binding energy shape resembling its path. These forces largely retain their original forms from the atom's growth. In appropriate gases, structures change in atoms above, at, and below the ground. A structure's dimension relies on the number of electrons moving together. Binding in gaseous element atoms occurs from above, while in solids, it's from below.

Vijay Mallya, a brewing industry leader, has recently started Kingfisher Airlines, and Richard Branson, a British businessman, has expressed his desire to launch an Indian airline.\n\nWith a population exceeding one billion, India is seen by many as an under-served market for airlines. However, the thriving economy has increased individual purchasing power and expanded both the middle class and the business community. The Indian government supports more affordable and accessible air travel. According to Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel, air travel is no longer just for the wealthy. Construction is underway to accommodate the anticipated increase in demand, and a consortium led by Siemens of Germany has been awarded a contract to construct a private airport near Bangalore, according to Agence France Presse. India's airports authority and the local state government will each hold a 13% ownership stake in the finished transportation center. Air Deccan, founded by former military officer and silk producer Gorur Gopinath, intends to expand its fleet to sixty planes within half a decade.

He communicated to those in attendance in Brighton that the Labour government has been defined by a lack of faith and the inability to accomplish what they set out to do. Additionally, he criticized the government's inability to manage immigration and asylum issues, as well as its performance concerning the National Health Service, telling conference participants that Labour could not be trusted regarding education or crime.

The defense, environment, and trade departments, all of which increased their document destruction, stated they were adhering to regulations regarding public records. The Conservatives, however, desire an investigation by the information commissioner. The Freedom of Information Act will, for the first time, grant the public access to government records previously kept confidential for three decades. According to BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy, the possibility of outsiders investigating the inner workings of Whitehall seems to be creating anxiety among government officials.\nLiberal Democrat Alan Beith, who leads the select committee overseeing the Department of Constitutional Affairs, stated that if these allegations were accurate, Whitehall was \"acting entirely against the spirit of the new Act\". He added that both the information commissioner and the select committee would need to closely monitor the issue. Fellow Lib Dem Norman Baker stated the situation presented an \"unflattering picture of the inner workings of government,\" adding that the government's initial enthusiasm for open government had become self-serving cynicism. Dr. Julian Lewis, the Conservative spokesman for the Cabinet Office, stated that he had discovered a major increase in shredding based on several parliamentary responses.\nThe Department of Work and Pensions disposed of nearly 37,000 files last year, which is an increase of 22,000 compared to four years prior, when the Act was passed. The number of files destroyed by the Ministry of Defence and the Departments of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Trade and Industry has also risen dramatically. Dr. Lewis has requested an investigation by information commissioner Richard Thomas. Earlier in the week, Mr. Thomas announced he was investigating Cabinet Office orders instructing staff to delete e-mails older than three months. He stated he \"totally condemned\" deleting e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws, which were to take effect on January 1st.\nAccording to government guidance, e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose,\" Mr. Thomas said. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman stated that the action was not related to the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". The Freedom of Information Act will apply to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland starting next year. Similar measures are being implemented in Scotland concurrently.

Ogden and a friend are missing. Burns volunteers to search for them in London, and Audrey urges him to find Ogden, as her job depends on it. It turns out Burns bribed Ogden to run away to London and arranged for his valet to send him to his mother, Nesta Ford. Headmaster Abney, confined to bed with a cold, dispatches White to London with Burns, only to discover that White witnessed Burns giving Ogden directions and reveals himself as Smooth Sam Fisher, proposing to join Burns in the kidnapping. Burns flees to his flat, but Ogden hasn't arrived. Fisher arrives, having followed Burns, but leaves to search for Ogden when he learns the boy is enjoying London. After searching, Burns finds Ogden at his friend's mother's house and brings him back to school. Fisher returns, threatening to expose Burns if he is revealed. Ogden is moved to a secure room, and guarded; Burns' relationship with Audrey cools after he is reminded he is engaged, and he stops another attempt by Fisher to abduct the boy. The school term ends, but Mr. Ford is delayed, so Abney asks Burns, Audrey, and White to guard Ogden. Fisher then reveals Burns' plan to return Ogden to his mother. Burns leaves in shame, but returns and warns Audrey about Fisher, but she remains distrustful, and he notices MacGinnis's presence. He drives Fisher away and guards Ogden himself, still lacking Audrey's trust. Fisher returns with MacGinnis, offering Burns a final chance, which he refuses. With the phone lines cut, Burns tries to sneak Ogden away, but they are trapped in the school stables. Ogden gives himself up, tired of the chase, and Audrey cries, comforted by Burns. Later, Burns and Audrey acknowledge their love, but she insists he honor his commitment to Cynthia. They part, and Cynthia's mother arrives with Nesta Ford. Mr. Ford also arrives, along with Sam Fisher, who convinces Ford to reconcile with his wife and employ him as Ogden's security guard, in lieu of a ransom. Ford agrees and they leave. Mrs. Drassilis reveals that Cynthia is in love with Lord Mountry, and Burns releases her from their engagement and pursues Audrey.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Standard techniques usually require simultaneous access to images from both datasets. However, the original training images are often unavailable during adaptation, a common situation in medical imaging when data comes from different places. A new method is proposed for adapting segmentation networks that removes this requirement. The method reduces entropy without labels on the target data and uses a prior on segmentation regions that is consistent across domains. This prior, representing class ratios, is learned using a second network and incorporated via Kullback-Leibler divergence. The approach is demonstrated to effectively adapt spine segmentation across different MRI types. The results are comparable to other methods, even without using the original training images. The strategy is simple, using only one network, unlike adversarial methods that need the source images.

China's rapid growth has driven high demand for raw materials and energy, potentially causing global repercussions if the economy overheats. However, government officials noted a deceleration in industrial growth, with the service sector playing a more significant role. Industrial output growth, a primary target of government restrictions on credit and investments, decreased from 17% the prior year to 11.5% in 2004. Consumer prices saw a faster increase than in 2004, reaching 2.4%, adding to concerns that a substantial increase in producer prices, at 7.1%, could fuel inflation. Investment in fixed assets remained elevated, rising by 21.3% compared to the previous year, although it was below the peak of 43% observed in the first quarter of 2004.

{"id": 6586, "text": "This study introduces deep learning techniques to order response surfaces, applicable to optimal stopping problems within financial math. The problem of ranking these surfaces arises from the need to estimate optimal feedback policy maps in stochastic control, with the goal of finding the index linked to the lowest response across all continuous input possibilities. By viewing points as pixels and indices of the minimal surfaces as labels, the problem is reinterpreted as image segmentation, which labels each pixel in an image so that pixels sharing a label have similar traits. This offers another way to address the problem efficiently, differing from previous sequential design methods. Deep learning algorithms offer scalability, parallel processing, and a model-free approach, not requiring parametric assumptions about the response surfaces. Framing ranking as image segmentation allows the use of various deep neural networks, such as UNet, SegNet, and DeconvNet, which have been widely used and shown to be accurate. The dependence of these algorithms on input data, generated from uniform grids or sequential design sampling, is also investigated. The results suggest that deep learning performance is not highly affected by noise or the location of training data. Several examples, including both synthetic cases and the Bermudan option pricing problem, are provided to illustrate the method's effectiveness and precision.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Unlike transverse waves in lines of purely electrical particles that are always regular, the reversed wave's behavior doesn't follow the normal light behavior because its dipolar characteristics don't match up with the electric and magnetic fields of a standard wave in open space. Also, the reversed waves are much narrower than the regular waves.

This will mean that a significant number of Britons will be excluded from vital services, according to a report. The report also claims that the idea that the problem of unequal access to the internet will simply disappear over time is unrealistic. The government and the telecommunications industry are urged to develop new strategies to engage those who have been excluded from the digital world. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will decrease slightly, those who remain disconnected will experience greater disadvantages, according to the report. As more and more tasks move online, the divide will become more noticeable and burdensome for those without internet access. The report predicts future patterns based on current data and technological changes, suggesting that optimists who think that technological advancements will solve the problem may be mistaken. Internet access through other devices is more common among those who already have it. While the cost of internet access has decreased and coverage in remote areas has improved, the main obstacle is psychological. Many people still lack the motivation, skills, or awareness of the advantages of being online. Those from disadvantaged groups, such as low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled, are likely to remain disconnected. The report projects that those with low incomes, the disabled, and the elderly will make up a large percentage of the digital have-nots.

These methods are contrasted with standard inflation and localization techniques, and results are shown using simulations from a simple nonlinear chaotic system.

Semantic segmentation is a core task in remote sensing, and current advanced methods commonly utilize deep convolutional neural networks. Their effectiveness is largely due to the ability of deep networks to gather contextual information from extensive areas. This advantage, however, results in reduced spatial resolution, blurring fine details and object edges. To address this, we suggest integrating semantic segmentation with edge detection that uses semantic information, thereby highlighting class boundaries within the model. Initially, we develop a relatively simple and efficient model by incorporating boundary detection into the Segnet encoder-decoder structure. Secondly, we also integrate boundary detection into FCN-type models and establish a high-performing classifier combination. The results demonstrate that integrating boundary detection significantly enhances semantic segmentation using CNNs.

Post-2003 World Cup, he mandated a sufficient conditioning period for players annually, which materialized last summer with a ten-week start to this season. This may have irritated Scottish and especially Welsh counterparts who felt the Celtic League was disrespected. The author won't comment on Mike Ruddock selecting eight Dragons players who had recently played Leinster. Ruddock, like O'Sullivan, was within his rights, especially considering national pride. The IRFU supported O'Sullivan, who likely appreciates centrally-controlled contracts. Except for Keith Gleeson, recovering from a leg injury, O'Sullivan's squad is fit and ready for the season.\n\nO'Sullivan likely won't boast about his player management, as that's not his style. However, he might compare his team to the overworked and injured squads of England, Wales, and France, and feel satisfied with his planning. The crucial aspect is translating this freshness into positive results during games. Ireland is considered a favorite to win the championship, potentially achieving their first Grand Slam since 1948. With England and France playing at Lansdowne Road before its demolition, the situation seems ideal, but this has historically unnerved Irish teams.\n\nIreland has struggled under immense pressure, like the 1985 Triple Crown-winning team that failed to secure a Grand Slam in 1986 and was whitewashed. Ireland often performs better when expectations are lowered. O'Sullivan's team is capable of proving a point this season. After their first Triple Crown in 19 years, they can build upon their achievements. O'Sullivan has shown faith in his players, who have reciprocated, and further success is anticipated. Despite some older players, he will approach the championship with new strategies and enthusiasm. Ireland has the potential to succeed, but this should be spoken quietly.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This paper presents a shape-constrained segmentation method using multi-task deep learning and atlas propagation for short-axis cardiac magnetic resonance images. A fully convolutional network simultaneously learns segmentation and landmark localization. The network architecture employs a 2.5D representation, balancing computational efficiency and 3D spatial consistency. A refinement stage explicitly enforces shape constraints, enhancing segmentation quality. This refinement overcomes artifacts from breath-hold variations and slice thickness, which can hinder accurate 3D cardiac shape creation. Landmark inference automates the pipeline, initializing atlas propagation. The pipeline's performance is validated on datasets of healthy individuals and those with pulmonary hypertension. Experimental results show robustness and the creation of accurate, high-resolution, and anatomically smooth bi-ventricular 3D models, despite artifacts in the input images.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Current techniques use either multi-planar 2D networks or full 3D networks, both of which have drawbacks: 2D networks struggle with 3D spatial understanding, while 3D networks require significant memory and can be unstable due to the lack of pre-trained models.\n\nThis research introduces a new method called Elastic Boundary Projection (EBP) to connect 2D and 3D processing. The core concept is that segmentation primarily involves identifying the 2D surface of a 3D object's boundary. The approach positions a set of points in 3D space and calculates the distance from each point to the object boundary in many directions. This creates an adjustable shell, initially a sphere, around each point. A 2D deep network is trained to determine if the shell's endpoints lie within the object, refining the shell to match the object's boundary and achieve segmentation.

However, video segmentation with recurrent neural networks has issues like many parameters and high computational cost, slowing down processing significantly. Drawing from successes with spatial and depthwise separable convolutional neural networks, this work adapts these methods for convLSTMs to lower parameter count and FLOPs.

Unlike typical CRFs that use linear combinations of parametric models for potential functions, and learn coefficients with structured support vector machines (SSVMs), this approach uses nonparametric forests \u2013 decision tree ensembles \u2013 to define unary and pairwise potentials. The ensemble parameters and trees are learned simultaneously within a large-margin optimization framework, enabling nonlinear learning of potential functions for both unary and pairwise CRF terms. Additionally, class-specific decision trees are learned for each object present in the image. The decision trees\u2019 structure and adaptability allow for effective modeling of intricate data likelihoods and label connections. The resulting optimization problem is complex, involving potentially exponential numbers of variables and constraints. This difficult optimization is tackled using a combination of modified column generation and cutting-plane methods, resulting in efficient solving.

Health analyst Tony Beddow described the new goals as \"reasonably impressive.\"\n\nHutt also revealed that \u00a3264 million for health services would be allocated to reducing waiting times, enhancing key areas, and modernizing staff pay structures in Wales. Hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting \"unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year.\" She said that long waits in Wales are improving and the targets intend to ensure no-one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant. Rhodri Glyn Thomas of Plaid Cymru said the target was dependent on a second offer, and a failure. Kirsty Williams of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said the new target was \"hugely unambitious\" and Jonathan Morgan, a Conservative, said waiting lists have increased. The latest monthly waiting list figures indicated a 9.8% decrease in the number of people waiting over 18 months as inpatients. Figures to the end of November indicated a drop since October, and the number waiting over 12 months also fell. There are currently 305,775 people on a waiting list of some kind, down from 311,764 last month.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Because they can't afford his winnings, the show's host, Prem Kumar, and the producers accuse him of cheating, employing the police to arrest him because they assumed an uneducated person wouldn't know the answers. Ram recounts to his lawyer, Smita Shah, the events that led him to know the answers to each question, explaining how each question was connected to a significant moment in his life. He highlights the chance nature of the questions, expressing his luck that they were questions he knew. The narrative unfolds through flashbacks, showcasing Ram's life experiences in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Agra. These experiences include his unconventional upbringing by a priest, various jobs, such as working for a Bollywood actress, in a foundry, for a spying Australian diplomat, as a tour guide, and as a bar waiter. Salim, another orphan and Ram's friend who aspires to become an actor, plays a significant role in his life. A palmist had predicted a short life for Ram, a prediction he disregards. Salim eventually realizes his acting dream after a heroic act. Critical events unfold when Ram works as a guide at the Taj Mahal, where he falls in love with a prostitute named Nita. He tries to buy her freedom from her pimp, who refuses. Meanwhile, Ram's friend Shankar needs money for a rabies vaccination, but he dies, and Ram steals the money to give to an English teacher whose son needs it, who later assists Ram on the show.

It airs daily on television and radio. People gather each Friday in Luanda's Independence Square to record messages for broadcast in the hope that a lost relative will see them. Several families have been reunited during broadcasts. According to Sergio Gera, the program's chief co-ordinator, the number of people attending was extremely high at the beginning, but is now slightly lower, yet still substantial.\n\nThe effort of Angolans searching for family members has received much media attention. The war resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of people remaining missing. Many individuals have been out of contact for at least ten years. It's estimated that the vast majority of Angolan families have lost a family member.\n\nThe process of recording messages in Independence Square was inspired by a similar concept in Buenos Aries, Argentina. One woman, Victoria Lapete, located her sister, who was the only remaining member of her family, during a live broadcast of Meeting Point in Independence Square, after being separated for 28 years. She explained the happiness and emotion of the moment they were reunited. However, Angola is an impoverished country and relatively few people have access to television or radio. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is crucial in reuniting families. The ICRC publishes the Gazetta in Wambo, which contains 13,000 names of missing or displaced people.\n\nLandmines scattered around the country make their work more difficult. According to Joaquim Sahundi, head of tracing in Wambo, there are many displaced people who are attempting to return home or locate relatives, and they are often injured by mines in uncleared areas. Where possible, the ICRC uses the media, broadcasting lists of missing people four times a day on Radio Angola. Reuniting Angolan families presents significant obstacles. Rafael Marques, from the pro-democracy George Soros Foundation for Southern Africa, stated that in order for the families to remain together, social integration, job access, education, and healthcare are required.

{"id": 6693, "text": "A Chinese loan of $6 billion aided Russia in regaining control of Yuganskneftegas, a key part of the Yukos oil group. The Russian government disclosed that VEB, a Russian state bank, received the $6 billion from Chinese banks and then lent it to Rosneft, a state-owned company, to facilitate the Yugansk acquisition. This information coincided with the announcement of a long-term oil supply agreement between Rosneft and CNPC, a Chinese company, where Rosneft would receive $6 billion in credit from CNPC. These credits would be used to repay the loans Rosneft had taken out to buy Yugansk, according to the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. Initially, CNPC was offered 20% of Yugansk in exchange for financing, but they opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead, possibly due to potential lawsuits from Yukos, the previous owner of Yugansk, had CNPC become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. An official from the Russian oil industry, Sergei Oganesyan, stated that the two companies had agreed on prepayment for long-term deliveries and that a prepayment of five to six years was not unusual. These events clarify how Rosneft, a relatively unknown and indebted firm, managed to finance its unexpected purchase of Yugansk, which was sold for $9.3 billion in an auction the previous year to help Yukos settle a $27 billion tax and fine debt. Yukos, which had previously sought bankruptcy protection in a US court to prevent the forced sale of its main production unit, claimed its downfall was due to the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion. The agreement between Rosneft and CNPC reflects China's ambition to secure long-term oil supplies to support its growing economy, as China's demand for resources like crude oil has contributed to record high global commodity prices. According to Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at Aton, China is seeking leverage in Russia and prioritizes guaranteed supplies over property rights. Lukashov added that if the price of oil is fixed in the deal, it could be very beneficial for China, and the deal is also advantageous for Rosneft, which urgently needs cash.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This paper tackles this problem by focusing on representation learning. It argues that collapsing representations contribute to the problem but can be avoided with transfer learning. Therefore, a new two-step method is introduced for more reliable and general segmentation. It starts with an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) to learn useful representations that improve generalization and robustness. This learned knowledge is then applied to segmentation. By adding an image reconstruction network, the representation is decoded, pushing the model to find more semantic features. Lung segmentation experiments using multiple chest X-ray datasets were performed. The tests show that this new method generalizes well to new situations, performing well and being resistant to data corruption, even with limited training data.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Within these letters, she recounts their relationship prior to and during the time their son was conceived, followed by events in Kevin's life that culminated in the deadly school attack, and her reflections regarding her relationship with her husband. She also confesses to previously concealed actions, such as breaking Kevin's arm when she suddenly became enraged. Eva is also depicted visiting Kevin in prison. Their connection is depicted as icy and combative in these scenes. Kevin\u2019s actions throughout the narrative suggest antisocial personality disorder, yet this is only subtly suggested and mostly inferred by the audience. He shows little to no care or ethical behavior toward his family; indeed, Kevin seems to scorn everyone with contempt and hatred, especially his mother, whom he has tormented for as long as he remembers. He performs minor acts of destruction from a young age, like spraying ink on a room his mother has carefully wallpapered in rare maps, to possibly inciting a girl to hurt her skin. Archery, which his father teaches him, is the one activity he enjoys. As Kevin's behavior worsens, Franklin becomes increasingly defensive of him, convinced that his son is a normal boy and that there is a logical justification for everything. Kevin pretends to be a caring, obedient son when Franklin is present, which Eva sees through. This causes a split between Eva and Franklin that is never fully resolved; Franklin asks for a divorce shortly before the massacre. Celia, Kevin's sister, is born mainly because Eva desires to connect with another member of her family. Celia loses an eye at the age of six in a household \"accident\" involving drain cleaner. This is closely related to an earlier incident involving Celia's pet elephant shrew, during which Eva uses Liquid Plumr, a caustic drain cleaner, to clear a blockage in the children's sink. There are two possible scenarios: Eva left the cleaner within Celia's reach, or Kevin somehow used it to attack Celia, destroying her eye and scarring her face. Though never proven, Eva is convinced that Kevin, who was babysitting at the time, poured the Liquid Plumr onto his sister's face, telling her he was cleaning her eye. Eva finally discloses that Franklin and Celia are deceased while telling the story of the massacre\u2014Kevin killed them both with his bow and arrow set before attacking his school with these weapons. Eva believes he did this because he overheard her and Franklin talking about getting a divorce; he believed Franklin would get custody of him, thus denying him ultimate triumph over his mother. The book concludes on the second \"anniversary\" of the massacre, three days before Kevin turns 18 and is transferred to Sing Sing. Subdued and frightened, he makes amends with Eva by giving her Celia's prosthetic eye to bury and apologizing. Eva asks Kevin for the first time why he committed the murders, and Kevin replies that he is no longer sure. They embrace, and Eva determines that she still loves her son.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Meta-labels, like the 2D slice location in a 3D MRI or the device type, are often available at no additional cost during data collection.

To maximize the use of weak annotations, a self-paced learning method is applied to aid learning and distinguish useful labels from irrelevant ones.

Heinous acts against vulnerable populations illustrate the negative impact of misused power.\n\nThose who misuse their power shouldn't possess it, yet they cling to it desperately. Power is helpful in the correct hands and dangerous in the wrong ones. Power is fine if used properly, but some leaders become cruel and enjoy it. Rightfully used power is a boon, and virtuous leaders deserve admiration for their empathy and positive impact.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 6741, "text": "A major union for UK government employees will ask its 290,000 members to vote on whether to strike because the government wants to increase their pension age to 65. The Public and Commercial Services Union will align any strike with as many as six other public sector unions. Unions have already set aside March 23 for a potential one-day strike that could include as many as 1.4 million UK workers. The government stated that unions will be consulted before any modifications are made to the pension system. PCS leader Mark Serwotka cautioned that there might be further strikes unless the government reconsiders. He stated it was hypocritical for the government to limit choices for public sector workers regarding their pensions. He said that demanding workers work five extra years to receive their promised pension was unacceptable in the 20th century. A BBC correspondent stated that the combined unions could significantly pressure the government before the General Election. A civil servant strike could severely disrupt or shut down government offices, agencies, and museums. Our correspondent added that all unions agree on opposing the increase in the retirement age. Unison, the Transport and General Workers' Union, and Amicus are among those being balloted about a March 23 strike. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott met privately with senior union leaders on Thursday night. Our correspondent reported that no agreement was reached at the meeting but that further negotiations were possible. He added that there was a chance the strike could be averted.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

Roddick, the number one seed and current title holder, defeated Haas of Germany, the third seed, by a score of 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. Saulnier advanced to the final after overcoming an ankle injury in his semi-final match against Melzer, the seventh seed from Austria. Despite the injury, the Frenchman prevailed over Melzer, who was upset about several line calls, with a score of 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3. Roddick commented that he had been feeling unwell earlier in the week and that his performance was a step forward. He added that he was improving his return game by positioning himself further inside the court. Roddick secured the first set by winning the last four points of the tie-break, but he was broken at the beginning of the second set. However, he immediately broke back and then broke Haas again to take a 4-2 lead. Haas expressed his frustration at not capitalizing on opportunities against a top-five player, noting that he hurried some backhands and Roddick took advantage. Saulnier's advancement to the final will result in him entering the world's top 50 for the first time. He explained that reaching the final required a lot of effort and mental fortitude, adding that he sometimes doubted his ability to reach a final but remained mentally strong. Saulnier stated that he is improving, will continue to fight and work hard, and expects to rise in the rankings.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

The Bloglines website has gained popularity since it allows users to read, search, and share blogs in one location. Ask Jeeves plans to use Bloglines' archived articles to add to their web index and will not change the site. Bloglines lets users follow chosen blogs without visiting each site via RSS technology. Other search sites have made similar acquisitions, such as Google buying Blogger, MSN introducing its blog system, and Yahoo improving its blog entry handling. Ask Jeeves states the acquisition is for information retrieval rather than blog publishing. Ask Jeeves says readers are more numerous than writers. The acquisition will complement Ask's My Jeeves service, which enables customized web experiences and personal link collections. Search engines facilitate initial information discovery, while RSS helps track and monitor sites. It will also bring information and blog entries to Ask Jeeves' portals. Immediate changes to Bloglines are not planned. Ask Jeeves will take time to determine the business model and assist in organizing Bloglines' database using their indexing technology.

{"id": 6744, "text": "The European Indoor trials suggested that a handful of athletes could contend for medals at the upcoming European Championships. It was encouraging to see progress, new talent, and personal bests achieved. Sarah Claxton's 60m hurdles victory stood out due to her consistent sub-eight-second times, putting her in medal contention. The pressure she faced and her victory over Diane Allahgreen boosted her confidence. Allan Scott also showed promise in the men's hurdles, and the event's strength could lead to three selections for Madrid. Phillips Idowu's impressive 17.30m triple jump topped the world rankings. Despite runway concerns, his performance highlighted his talent, though consistency is still needed. Kelly Sotherton demonstrated development with personal bests in multiple events, positioning her as a medal contender in the pentathlon against Carolina Kluft. Her training approach seems effective. Jason Gardener's 60m win was not his best, and Jeanette Kwayke's race was affected by Joice Maduaka's absence. Janine Whitlock's return to pole vault was positive, but the lack of domestic competition was a concern.

According to Mr. Blair, the fact that Turkey is a Muslim nation shouldn't prevent its inclusion. The deal to begin official discussions with Ankara occurred despite an EU request for Turkey to acknowledge Cyprus. Although they agreed the matter could be addressed later, Turkish leader Recep Erdogan had to acknowledge that discussions didn't ensure complete EU membership.\n\nTurkey might need to accept limitations on citizen migration if it were to join. Mr. Blair stated that Turkey's EU membership would be important \"to the future peace and prosperity of my country, Britain, and the wider world.\"\n\n\"We are asserting a key idea: that being a Muslim nation shouldn't exclude Turkey from Europe. Instead, if it upholds the same human rights standards, Muslims and Christians can collaborate.\" As part of the arrangement, Turkey must provide a written declaration committing to sign an agreement that effectively recognizes the Greek Cypriot administration, but it has more time to promote the idea to its population.\n\nWhile the internationally recognized southern region of Cyprus belongs to the EU, Turkey, which controls northern Cyprus, had previously refused to recognize the nation, referring to the situation as a \"red line.\" Turkey's accession could take up to 15 years, and admission is not assured. The EU also declared that it will begin accession talks with Croatia in April 2005, but only if the nation fully cooperates with the UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 6746, "text": "Dilated convolutions are effective for image segmentation. They expand receptive fields using gaps in filters, maintaining kernel size. While efficiently capturing features at various scales, the filter design causes information loss. We believe simple changes to these networks, like adding averaging layers, can fix this. We tested this by assessing the impact of these changes on a top image segmentation system, comparing it to other methods. Results show our methods improve dilated convolution performance for image segmentation. Importantly, our changes are computationally cheaper than previous smoothing methods.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
{"id": 6747, "text": "Image segmentation is key for many visual processes. Convolutional neural networks perform well on segmenting single images, but recurrent gated architectures haven't been thoroughly explored for video segmentation. A new method for online video sequence segmentation is presented that uses temporal information. The network contains convolutional elements and a recurrent unit operating on a sliding temporal window. A new convolutional gated recurrent unit is introduced, retaining spatial data and decreasing learned parameters. The method can function online rather than processing the entire video frame batch. Testing on a change detection dataset shows a 5.5% F-measure improvement over a basic fully convolutional network for individual frame segmentation. A 1.4% F-measure improvement was also demonstrated compared to a baseline network called FCN 12s.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}

This paper introduces a new method using a multi-level activation layer and three associated loss functions to embed this information. Testing on nuclei segmentation in bright-field microscopy cell images from the 2018 Data Science Bowl demonstrates its effectiveness on a task with cells and nested substructures. This method accelerates learning and surpasses standard multi-class classification with soft-max activation, as well as a method derived from it, with significant Dice score improvements. The approach is straightforward, easily implemented, and adaptable to various CNN architectures, generalizing to more classes with or without containment relationships.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Gemini"}}
