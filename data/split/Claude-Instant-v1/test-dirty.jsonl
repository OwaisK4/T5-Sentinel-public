The emission distribution remains constant across models, with differences arising from the Markovian prior labeling hypothesis. The a priori labeling knowledge is modeled using a) a second order anisotropic Markov Mesh and b) a classical isotropic Potts model. Three segmentation procedures are considered: 2D Path Constrained Viterbi training for the Hidden Markov Mesh, Graph Cut based segmentation for the first order isotropic Potts model, and ICM for the second order isotropic Potts model.\n\nWe provide a unified perspective on these methods and investigate classification performance by examining parameter estimation, computational efficiency, and automation level through statistical measures like Overall Accuracy, Relative Improvement, and Kappa coefficient. This enables robust analysis of synthetic and real-life experimental data from Dental Diagnostic Radiography. Algorithms using learned parameters generate effective segmentations with minimal interaction when images have clear multimodal histograms.

{"id": 6016, "text": "We propose an active learning approach to image segmentation that exploits geometric priors to speed up and streamline the annotation process. It can be applied for both background-foreground and multi-class segmentation tasks in 2D images and 3D image volumes. Our approach combines geometric smoothness priors in the image space with uncertainty measures to estimate the most informative pixels or voxels for annotation. For multi-class settings, we introduce two novel uncertainty criteria. In the 3D case, we use the uncertainty measure to select voxels on a planar patch, making batch annotation more convenient. The planar patch is found using a branch-and-bound algorithm that identifies a 2D patch in a 3D volume with the most informative instances. We evaluate our approach on Electron Microscopy and Magnetic Resonance image volumes, as well as on images of horses and faces, demonstrating a substantial performance increase over other approaches due to geometric priors.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

However, supervised deep learning methods often face challenges due to the scarcity of labeled medical image data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain. This paper introduces a semi-supervised method for medical image segmentation that optimizes the network using a weighted combination of supervised loss for labeled inputs and regularization loss for both labeled and unlabeled data. The method promotes consistent network predictions for the same input under different regularizations. By introducing a transformation-consistent scheme in a self-ensembling model, the regularization effect for pixel-level predictions is enhanced. The proposed method was validated on three medical image segmentation tasks: skin lesion segmentation, optic disc segmentation, and liver segmentation. Compared to existing approaches, the method demonstrates superior performance on challenging 2D and 3D medical images, highlighting the effectiveness of the semi-supervised approach.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

Pixelwise tasks like image segmentation require feeding surrounding image patches into CNN to predict pixel classes and update parameters. Traditional whole-image classification approaches become inefficient when applied to pixelwise classification due to significant patch overlap causing redundant computations.\n\nOur algorithms remove redundant convolution and pooling computations by using d-regularly sparse kernels, producing identical results to patch-by-patch scanning. These kernels enable continuous memory access and efficient GPU processing. By applying a mask to the error map at the final CNN layer, a subset of patches can be selected for backward propagation with constant computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate speed improvements over 1500 times in forward and backward propagation, with performance gains increasing alongside image and patch sizes.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

{"id": 6184, "text": "\nImage segmentation is a crucial task in image processing that involves classifying pixels into groups based on their intensity levels and a threshold value. The segmentation quality depends on the threshold selection method. Classical multilevel thresholding implementations are computationally intensive due to exhaustive searches for optimal values. Evolutionary optimization approaches have gained popularity. The Electromagnetism Like algorithm (EMO) is an evolutionary method that simulates charge attraction and repulsion to evolve population members. EMO demonstrates superior search capabilities with low computational overhead. This paper introduces a multilevel thresholding algorithm using EMO, combining its search capabilities with Otsu and Kapur objective functions. The algorithm samples the image histogram to create EMO particles, evaluating their quality using Otsu or Kapur methods. EMO operators evolve candidate solutions guided by objective values to find an optimal solution. The approach efficiently identifies image threshold values with fewer iterations, as demonstrated by experimental results.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

{"id": 6225, "text": "\nInvestigating the exchange energy of two conduction electrons in a crystal reveals that the exchange energy can be negative, potentially favoring a singlet state. Complete wave function overlap in real space results in a deeper exchange energy, causing a bond between two conduction electrons. The singlet bond emerges because singlet electrons can simultaneously occupy one spatial ground state, lowering the average energy compared to unpaired electrons. This pairing stems from the Pauli Exclusion Principle. When conduction electrons are positioned on the Fermi surface in momentum space, each pair can exist permanently. Crystal electron motion might hinder Cooper pair formation due to higher kinetic energy compared to pair binding energy. As standing waves with zero momenta, conduction electrons become local and synchronous, enabling weak singlet bonds despite high Fermi surface kinetic energy. This local pairing of standing waves explains various superconductor phenomena. Electron pairs, behaving as bosons, can form a macroscopically coherent Bose-Einstein Condensate, becoming non-dissipative and non-local.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

The framework uses zx-calculus diagrammatic tools for quantum observables. This approach enables constructing stabilizer codes by deriving quantum codes from classical ones, and provides methods for discovering code classes through analytical and numerical techniques. We emphasize smaller codes relevant to near-term devices. We demonstrate that CSS codes are a subset of CPC codes and show how to compute stabilizers for CPC codes. We provide a method to convert classical [n,k,3] codes into [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC codes. We introduce a machine search technique generating thousands of potential codes, demonstrated for distance 3 and 5 codes. Additionally, we show how Clifford computation can be performed within CPC codes. Our framework offers a new approach for constructing small- to medium-sized codes with high rates, potentially suitable for emerging devices, while enabling integration with graphical compiler toolchains through zx-calculus foundations.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

By extending the eigenvalue problem to the complex plane, bound and decaying states can be incorporated into an expanded Hilbert space. Supersymmetry's flexibility in potential modification without altering spectra provides insight into the connection between complex KdV breather solutions, PT-symmetry, and the free particle on the complex plane.

Instead of training a single neural network on all available data, we train multiple networks on data subgroups representing different segmentation variations. Since segmentation styles are not always clearly defined or mapped to specific observers, we use a genetic algorithm to automatically determine these subgroups. This enables each network to learn a specific segmentation style from grouped training data.

{"id": 6353, "text": "Several methods of surface manufacturing based on ion beam sputtering, involving dual beam setups, sequential application of ion beams from different directions, or sample rotation, are studied using kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of ion beam erosion and surface diffusion. Only erosion dominated situations are considered. The results are compared to theoretical propositions and experimental findings. Two opposite ion beams produce stationary, symmetric ripples. Two ion beams at right angles produce square patterns only when exactly balanced. In other crossed beam cases, ripple patterns are created with predictable orientations from linear continuum theory. Sequential ion beam sputtering shows rapid destruction of structures from previous beam directions after rotation, leading to a transient roughness decrease. Pattern superpositions are difficult to obtain and exist only in short time windows. Single beam setups with a rotating sample reveal a non-monotonic roughness dependence on rotation frequency, with a minimum at the frequency corresponding to prestructure relaxation. The logarithm of structure height decreases proportionally to the inverse frequency.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

{"id": 6489, "text": "In recent years, convolutional neural networks have transformed medical image analysis by learning discriminative image features for classification and regression tasks. However, learning these features requires extensive manually annotated data, which is costly and limited by expert resources. Consequently, unsupervised, weakly-supervised, and self-supervised feature learning techniques have gained attention to utilize available data while reducing manual annotation efforts. This paper proposes a novel approach for training a cardiac MR image segmentation network by learning features through self-supervision by predicting anatomical positions. These positions serve as a supervisory signal without requiring additional manual annotation. The method demonstrates that this simple task provides a strong feature learning signal, achieving high segmentation accuracy comparable to or better than a U-net trained from scratch, particularly with limited data. When only five annotated subjects are available, the proposed method improves the mean Dice metric from 0.811 to 0.852 for short-axis image segmentation.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

Electron dynamics for one cycle create a binding energy pattern matching its movement path. Applied forces remain mostly aligned with the atoms' growth patterns. In appropriate gaseous elements, structures emerge in atoms above ground, semisolid atoms at ground surface, and solid atoms beneath ground. Structural dimensions depend on simultaneous electron dynamic counts. Gaseous element atoms bind from upward sides, while solid atom binding occurs from downward sides.

By employing local and global empirical interpolation to avoid fine grid computations, we develop a reduced-order approach that significantly reduces problem size while maintaining solution accuracy. Numerical examples of nonlinear multiscale partial differential equations solved with fully-implicit time marching schemes demonstrate the model reduction approach's ability to accelerate nonlinear flow simulations in high-contrast porous media.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

Magnetization behavior is characterized by anisotropy fields H_{eff}, H_{2\\parallel}, and H_{4\\parallel}. Interval calculations were used to determine anisotropy field numerical values.

This approach adapts a deterministic model error method previously explored in variational and extended Kalman filter contexts. Model error statistics for the analysis update are estimated using historical reanalysis increments and a model error evolution law. Two method variants are presented: one with time-constant model error statistics, and another with randomly sampled statistics at each analysis step. Numerical simulations on a low-order nonlinear chaotic system compare these methods with standard inflation and localization approaches. Results indicate significant filter performance improvements and reduced parameter tuning compared to conventional methods. The proposed approach is straightforward to implement in existing ensemble-based schemes, with broader implications for square-root filters like ETKF.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

{"id": 6663, "text": "Semantic Segmentation is crucial for autonomous robots like self-driving cars. Video segmentation approaches offer an advantage over single image segmentation by considering temporal image information, improving performance. Single image segmentation methods are enhanced by incorporating recurrent units such as convolutional LSTM (convLSTM) cells into the network architecture. However, video segmentation approaches using recurrent neural networks are criticized for their large parameter count and computational complexity, with inference time for one video frame taking up to 66 percent longer than basic versions. Inspired by spatial and depthwise separable convolutional neural networks, this work generalizes these techniques for convLSTMs to reduce parameters and FLOPs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed modified convLSTM cells achieve similar or slightly lower accuracy but are up to 15 percent faster on a GPU compared to standard convLSTM cells.

The initial section is derived from a pre-trained object classification network and applied to four image scales. The network has two branches: one predicts contour likelihood through classification, and the other learns the agreement among human labelers about contour presence using regression.\n\nOur multi-scale deep learning approach achieves state-of-the-art contour detection results without feature engineering.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}
