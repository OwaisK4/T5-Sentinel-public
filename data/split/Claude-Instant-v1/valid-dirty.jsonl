{"id": 6754, "text": "Broadcast MIMO techniques can increase downlink throughput in cellular networks by using channel state information (CSI) feedback from mobile devices over the uplink. This creates a mechanism to trade uplink capacity for increased downlink capacity. The study quantifies this tradeoff and examines the exchange ratio between feedback rate and downlink rate in finite and infinite networks. For high SNR, the uplink rate can be exchanged for increased downlink rate with a favorable exchange ratio. This ratio increases with channel coherence time and decreases with the number of measured base stations. In finite networks, dedicating a constant uplink fraction to CSI feedback can increase downlink multiplexing gain from 0 to 1. For infinite networks, the bounds show only doubly logarithmic scaling with SNR. The results demonstrate that adapting feedback rate can control the balance between uplink and downlink rates, which is crucial for cellular network operators responding to changing user demands.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

{"id": 6756, "text": "Deep learning-based medical image segmentation technology seeks to automatically recognize and annotate objects in medical images. Non-local attention and multi-scale feature learning methods are commonly used to model networks, driving progress in medical image segmentation. However, existing attention mechanisms have weak non-local receptive fields' connections for small objects, potentially causing important small object features in abstract or coarse feature maps to be overlooked. Current multi-scale methods primarily focus on different view sizes, resulting in sparse multi-scale features insufficient for small object segmentation. This work proposes a multi-dimensional attention segmentation model with cascade multi-scale convolution to predict accurate segmentation of small objects in medical images. Multi-dimensional attention modules serve as weight functions, providing coefficient modification for significant small object features. Cascade multi-scale convolution modules in each skip-connection path capture multi-scale features at different semantic depths.

{"id": 6798, "text": "Tumor growth prediction using volumetric medical imaging can improve treatment and surgical planning. Convolutional networks have shown higher accuracy than traditional models in predicting tumor volumes. Deep learning techniques show promise for this problem. However, current 2D patch-based approaches cannot fully utilize the spatio-temporal context of 4D tumor data and cannot predict clinically-relevant tumor properties beyond volumes. This paper proposes a ConvLSTM approach to extract tumor imaging appearances and capture temporal changes. The method extends ConvLSTM to the spatio-temporal domain (ST-ConvLSTM) by learning 3D contexts and longitudinal dynamics from multiple patient studies. The approach can incorporate non-imaging patient information. Experiments on a 33-patient 4D longitudinal tumor dataset show ST-ConvLSTM achieves a Dice score of 83.2%+-5.1% and RVD of 11.2%+-10.8%, significantly outperforming other methods.

The approach can incorporate semantic information for object classification when available, while still being able to track unknown objects. Experimental results show our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art tracking-by-detection techniques for typical object categories and can successfully track a wide range of objects.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

Domain generalization aims to train a model once that performs well across unseen domains. Medical imaging domains have smaller variations compared to natural images. We propose a deep stacked transformations (DST) approach, applying n transformations to each image during training to address domain-specific shifts. Evaluated on prostate, left atrial, and left ventricle segmentation tasks, DST models degrade only 11% on unseen datasets compared to 39% with conventional augmentation and 25% with CycleGAN-based adaptation. DST performs slightly better on the same domain and reaches state-of-the-art performance on large datasets.

{"id": 6889, "text": "Magnetic Resonance (MR) images inherently exhibit variations in signal intensity across acquisitions. Standardization is a post-processing technique that corrects inter-subject intensity variations by transforming image gray scales to ensure similar intensities represent similar tissue characteristics. The absence of a standard intensity scale in MRI creates challenges in tissue characterization, image display, and analysis, particularly in image segmentation. While this phenomenon is well-documented, the impact of standardization on medical image registration remains unexplored. This study investigates intensity standardization's influence on registration tasks through systematic and analytic evaluations using clinical MR images. Approximately 20,000 clinical MR image registration experiments were conducted and evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. The evaluations reveal that intensity variations between images compromise registration accuracy. The findings suggest that image registration precision depends not only on spatial and geometric similarities but also on intensity value similarities for corresponding tissues across different images.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

Previously, only two systems allowed such detection: phosphorus in silicon via electrical readout using a single electron transistor (SET) and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond through optical readout. While both methods achieved approximately 90% spin readout fidelity, their respective thermal and photon collection limitations hindered high-fidelity quantum applications. This research introduces a hybrid method using optical excitation to modify a silicon-based SET defect centre's charge state based on its spin, then electrically detecting this change. High-resolution optical frequency addressing overcomes thermal broadening, while charge sensing avoids photon collection challenges. Demonstrated with erbium in silicon, this approach could enable new quantum information processing architectures and expand detectable defect centres.

However, microscopic understanding of carrier modulation in electrolyte-gated electric double-layer transistors (EDLTs) remains limited due to imaging challenges at the buried electrolyte-semiconductor interface. This study presents a real-space mapping of channel conductance in ZnO EDLTs using a cryogenic microwave impedance microscope. By employing a thin spin-coated ionic gel layer, high-resolution sub-surface imaging becomes possible while preserving the ability to induce metal-insulator transitions. Microwave images reveal the spatial dynamics of channel conductance, including local variations during transition and uneven distribution under source-drain bias. This approach combining ultra-thin ion-gel gating and microwave imaging provides novel insights into local transport and mesoscopic electronic properties in EDLTs.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

{"id": 7076, "text": "Deep neural networks with full convolution show great promise for rapid and precise image segmentation. A key training challenge is data imbalance, especially in medical imaging like lesion segmentation, where lesion voxels are typically far fewer than non-lesion voxels. Unbalanced data training can result in predictions with high precision but low recall (sensitivity), which is particularly problematic in medical contexts where missing a condition is worse than false positives. Various approaches have been developed to address this, including balanced sampling, two-step training, sample re-weighting, and specialized loss functions. This research introduces a generalized loss function based on the Tversky index to better balance precision and recall when training 3D fully convolutional neural networks. Experimental validation on multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation using magnetic resonance images demonstrated improved performance metrics, including F2 score, Dice coefficient, and precision-recall curve area.

Existing SSL approaches typically regularize model training via network or data perturbation. This work proposes a novel dual-task-consistency semi-supervised framework that explicitly builds task-level regularization. The approach uses a dual-task deep network to simultaneously predict pixel-wise segmentation maps and geometry-aware level set representations. A differentiable task transform layer converts level set representations to segmentation maps. A dual-task consistency regularization is introduced between level set-derived and directly predicted segmentation maps for both labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements by incorporating unlabeled data, outperforming state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

Image segmentation techniques that visualize invasive and noninvasive areas can aid pathological analysis. Existing supervised segmentation methods struggle with unlabeled pathology images. The proposed approach uses a two-phase unsupervised representation learning and clustering strategy. The first phase uses spherical k-means to learn feature representations from training image patches, generating cluster centroids as feature extraction filters. The second phase applies conventional k-means to these representations and projects cluster labels onto target images. Experiments on lung cancer specimen images demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional k-means and Otsu thresholding methods, achieving a normalized mutual information score of 0.626 versus 0.168 and 0.167.

However, these techniques still had suboptimal convergence relative to the smoothness constant. This work introduces an accelerated stochastic ADMM algorithm with variance reduction, offering faster convergence than existing methods. The algorithm's theoretical analysis demonstrates an optimal dependence on the smoothness constant, and empirical results validate its superior performance.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

{"id": 7490, "text": "Deep residual learning has improved performance in 2D image recognition, but its application to volumetric data, especially in medical image computing, remains unexplored. This paper introduces VoxResNet, a deep voxelwise residual network adapted for 3D volumetric brain segmentation. The work presents two key contributions: first, extending deep residual learning to a 3D variant for volumetric data, and second, developing an auto-context version of VoxResNet that integrates low-level image features, shape information, and high-level context. Experimental results on brain MR image segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting the potential of 3D deep learning in volumetric image segmentation.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}

Rannoch bears a white mark on his forehead resembling an oak leaf, which to the Herla holds great meaning and power. A prophecy states that the deer with this mark would bring freedom to all Herla and be a healer who can communicate with all animals. The Lord of the Herds, Drail, wants Rannoch killed out of fear of The Prophecy. Drail is tricked and murdered by Sgorr, who militarizes the herd by training stags and young bucks. Rannoch escapes from the herd, accompanied by Bracken, his companions, and Bhreac, an old doe. Growing up outside of the herd, he struggles to choose between freedom and the prophecy's path.

{"id": 7497, "text": "\nMedical image segmentation in three dimensions is a critical challenge in medical image analysis, significantly impacting diagnostic and treatment processes. Deep neural networks have recently achieved remarkable progress in this domain. However, variations in instrumental settings, experimental procedures, and subject characteristics often impede the generalization capabilities of deep learning models due to inconsistencies across images from different medical institutions. This research introduces StyleSegor, a straightforward and efficient approach to address these inconsistencies. By applying neural style transfer to unlabeled data, the method aims to minimize differences in image properties such as brightness, contrast, and texture between labeled and unlabeled datasets. The approach additionally employs probabilistic adjustment of network outputs and utilizes ensemble learning for integrated predictions. Experimental validation on the MICCAI HVSMR 2016 whole heart segmentation benchmark dataset demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 29.91% improvement in total score compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The research confirms StyleSegor's effectiveness in 3D whole heart segmentation, particularly with highly variable data, with the implementation available on GitHub.", "extra": {"variant": "original", "source": "Claude"}}
